## Introduction

Lessonface, founded in 2013, is a Public Benefit Company whose purpose is to connect students with great teachers for live online music, language, and arts lessons. Their mission is to help students achieve their self-enrichment goals while treating teachers equitably. Lessonface is COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) compliant and designed for all ages.

I chose Lessonface as a competitor application because this website displayed many features I envision to include. These include the feature to personally match with a suitable teacher, reviews, and individual pages for teachers with information. However, I would like to focus only on instrument learning, and emphasize more on the idea that everyone is welcome to learn instruments. I would like to use Lessonface as inspiration and to help me decide what to build upon for my final project.

## Purpose of Usability Testing

The purpose of a Usability Test (UT) is to evaluate the usablity of the product. A moderator tests and observes a participant (who represents a user) and gathers their feedback. By using a UT, we can learn more about the usability problems on the website we found after conducting a heuristic evaluation. With UT, we can observe in real time a userâ€™s behavior while using the website.

### Heuristic Evaluation Recap

Upon conducting heuristic evaluation of Lessonface last week, I found that the three **main issues** were:

| Heuristic | User Control and Freedom | Consistency and Standards | Recognition Rather than Recall |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Usability Problem | Cannot remove instrument category when searching for music lessons, confusion | An element that appears to be a button but is not a button | Important links under nested menu |

I decided to focus on these heuristics for my UT session.

## Methodology

Considering these, I used UT and created **three tasks** to test the usability problems noted above according to the table below:

| Heuristic Being Tested | Usability problem | Task scenario |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| User control and freedom | Cannot remove instrument category when searching for music lessons, confusion | Finding a clarinet teacher, then changing to flute teacher |
| Consistency and standards | An element that appears to be a button but is not a button | Find the FAQs page and phone number from the top navigation |
| Recognition rather than recall | Important links under nested menu | Find the "About" page under the nested menu |

Next, I decided on and wrote down the most logical and natural steps to completing these tasks.

| Task Scenario | 1: Finding a teacher | 2: Looking for answers to questions | 3: Learning more about Lessonface |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Step 1 | Search for clarinet teachers | Find the FAQs page | Find the "About" page |
| Step 2 | Refine your search to Monday, Friday, and Saturday | Find the section regarding the cancellation and rescheduling policy | Read about the history of Lessonface |
| Step 3 | Refine your search to the Mandarin language | Find the phone number | Find information about the CEO of Lessonface |
| Step 4 | Change your search from clarinet to flute teachers | N/A | N/A |

**The process of the usability test was:**

- Introduction
- Informed Consent
- Background Questions
- Pre-Test Questions
- Task Scenarios
- Post-Test Questionnaire
- System Usability Scale (SUS)
- Product Satisfaction Card
- Demographics (not recorded)

I used **Zoom** to record the session between me an my participant on my PC, while my participant was sharing his screen through **Zoom** on his laptop. I paused the recording before the demographics and continued after, to thank him for his participation.
