# Making Music Learning Accessible to Everyone
## Assignment #1: Heuristic Evaluation
**Vivian Nguyen** | _Digital Humanities 110 - User Interface and Design_ | Spring 2022

### Project Description
> Many older adults believe that mastering a new musical instrument has little reputation for adults. Similar to learning a foreign language, learning an instrument is commonly seen as something that must be embedded during the formative (younger) years, otherwise the learner will be hopelessly behind, if not simply hopeless. It is believed that learning becomes much harder past the developmental stage of growth, so many individuals feel disheartened to start learning. As a child, I took a year of piano lessons, yet it was too costly for me to continue, coming from a disadvantaged background.

Now that I am an adult, with desires to continue the piano education I once had, I want to help others who find themselves wanting to learn an instrument past their formative years, and especially those who come from impoverished backgrounds and cannot afford traditional music teaching. I would like to create a free of charge online music school, that ideally contains original lesson plans (like Khan Academy), with regards to people of all ages and backgrounds.

### Severity Ratings for Usability Problems
| Rating | Importance |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |
