## Purpose of UX Storytelling 📖

The purpose of UX Storytelling is for the researcher, you, to understand your users by placing yourself inside the shoes of your users. By doing so, you can imagine yourself going through the user’s journey, and finding pain points during the process that can be improved upon during the designing stage. This way, the product can be designed specifically for the users identified through your studies.

## Design Features 🎨

1. **Sheet music database** that is accessible, high quality, and free
2. **Teacher finding/search feature** with a high level filter
3. **Scheduling lessons feature** with a calendar and confirmation

## Scenario + Journey Map 🗺

### Diego Jacinto: Searching up sheet music

**Why is Diego using this product?**

> Diego is a Mexican-American convenience store manager who started working after graduating high school. He started learning piano at a young age, but stopped after a year. He grew up with an underserved background and his parents never went to college, so it was hard to have food on the table, let alone pay for piano lessons. However, he feels like his days have been the same—going to work, going home, taking care of his parents and siblings—so he wants to pick up a hobby. He remembers that in his childhood, he felt a lot of joy from learning piano. His main worry is that his age would hinder his ability to relearn piano. He wants a way to learn the piano without feeling insecure about his age. He has minimal piano experience to begin with, so he wants to play some music he has learned in the past through this product first. However, since he hasn’t read sheet music in a while, he thinks it is best to enroll in some lessons.

**How is Diego using this product?**

> Diego used to play the song “River Flows in You” a lot in his childhood when he used to learn piano. He has the growing motivation to play and learn the song again, so he goes to search for the sheet music on Google. However, he is greeted with so many options: PDF files, scanned images, renditions. After being disappointed in some of the results, he then finds the product/website. This website includes the original sheet music for River Flows in You in high quality, and best of all, it’s free. He clicks on the tab “Sheet Music Database.” Using the search bar, he searches “River Flows in You” by Yiruma and is greeted with the correct search result on the website. He clicks on it, uses it, and tries playing it on the piano. He’s happy because he was able to play a song he used to play in the past. However, he is currently rusty with his sheet music reading, so he wants to schedule lessons with a piano teacher. He clicks on a button that reads, “Learn an Instrument Today”. He finds a high level search feature where he can search for teachers, and filter through the availabilities, instruments, and more. Because of his age, he is reluctant to schedule them. However, with much thinking, he decides to schedule piano lessons around his work schedule, by filtering the results to Friday and Saturday, so that his days don’t all feel the same anymore.

### Nidhi Singh: Scheduling lessons

**Why is Nidhi using this product?**

> Nidhi is a married mother, and has been married for about 15 years. She has a 10 year old daughter she loves very much. Because her daughter is an only child, she wants to have the best childhood for her. However, she cannot spend all of her time with her daughter, because she has shifts at the hospital. Her husband recently switched jobs and will be working longer shifts. Unfortunately, he is making less than before. She decides that during the times that their jobs overlap, she can sign her daughter up for something. Recently, her daughter has been showing signs of interest in learning either the piano and violin. However, she is not sure of what instrument to focus on, so she would like to explore some options. Through this product, she wants to schedule lessons with both piano and violin teachers, and figure out which instrument her daughter should stick with after a couple of lessons.
> 

**How is Nidhi using this product?**

> Nidhi, in search for violin and piano teachers on Google, stumbles upon this website/product. At first, she is really overwhelmed with how much information is on the website. Clicking around, she finds the “About” page, where she reads about the service, and finds it credible. She clicks on the call-to-action button on the hero section of the page that reads, “Learn an Instrument Today”. From there, she is led to a complicated search function where she can search for instructors for any instrument. Because she is overwhelmed, she clicks on the help icon in the lower left corner, which tells her a step-by-step process in how to choose a teacher and schedule lessons. She feels more confident now about using the search function, and filters her results to violin and piano teachers. She also adds a filter to the language spoken by the instructor, clicking on “Hindi,” as she thinks that she would feel comfortable with a teacher that can speak the same mother tongue as her. She then finds a violin and piano teacher for her daughter, and schedules the first lessons for her. Using the calendar, she is able to visually see what days and times can be scheduled. She chooses every Wednesday, 3-4 PM for violin lessons and every Friday, 4-5 PM for piano lessons.

## Reflection 💭

- I found that being creative with my personas and putting myself in their shoes was harder than I anticipated. Because the potential of my user base is so vast, I found myself having to choose between a couple personas I could make to narrow it down to two.
- Because I only had two personas, I think I couldn’t explore more persona possibilities, such as someone from an even older generation.
