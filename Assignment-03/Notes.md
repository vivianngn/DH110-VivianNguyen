### Background

- Student
- Nowadays don’t practice much, but has 10 years of piano experience and 6 years of flute in ms and hs band
- Most skilled at piano
- As a child wanted to play violin, but debated between piano and violin and ended up with playing piano. Regret not learning violin
- Learns new songs at home, but during education, learned at music teacher’s place. Mostly indifferent about songs given to him
    - Accessible? Yes
- Repetitive practicing to learn instrument, in the past would watch YT vids of professional pianists
- Piano is only instrument he uses, and only he uses it
- Past, played piano an hour per day. Recently, plays piano an hour per week.
- Set off the weekend to learn a new song, for about two hours
- Sheet music is half accessible and half inaccessible, as Musescore might have a subscription service
- Other than repetitive practice, a teacher is helpful for learning, and YouTube
- YouTube very common resource, didn’t know what else to use.
    - Has accessible sheet music from people who make sheet music for free, with a live demonstration
- Sometimes uses forums like Reddit for finger placement help
- 5% of learning music is for social reasons, 95% for himself (motivation)
- Always learned with a teacher, who only recommended YouTube

### General Task

- Wanting to improve at league of legends (as an example)
- Usually goes on reddit, subreddit called Summoner School
- Looks at interesting posts and comments, skims through and applies information learned through the game
- Can look for a coach on the same subreddit and meet with coach
- Then, repetitive practice to becoming better
- Reddit is pretty good at helping you, as it has been around for so long and its like a library of knowledge. There are people with the same questions
- Just comfortable, something he would have done in the past
- Tried asking advice from friends, and online, there are forums but reddit is more efficient
- There are videos on different websites that are designed to make you learn, but are too long, so reading is faster
- Takes about 30 minutes, reads a little, but doesn’t post because all of the questions he has are there
- Sees himself potentially posting in the future, other than requesting a coach, did not really post
- Never mind, posted once
- Satisfied, because he was able to get information he wanted and could apply in game
- Knows if he mastered the material as it is a competitive game
- Mobalytics exists, but is more confusing to him, so uses Reddit. Not as in depth because there is no forum, and Reddit design is more simple

### Learning an instrument

- Uses Musescore, off the top of his head
- If he wanted to learn violin, would search for the basics of learning violin, and would watch a short YouTube video
- Longer videos, less inclined to click on
- Probably would not use wikihow, because it is not what he is looking for, wants to learn from a website dedicated to instrument learning
- Clicks on violinonline.com, which has a lot of resources
    - Could be better, can include short 1-2 minute videos
- Does not know of other resources that can help
- Decided to use through Google search, whatever that came up and caught his eye
- In the beginning, learning takes longer, so 2 hours a day
- Feeling comfort would help him decide if he mastered the instrument
- Satisfied with the website because it includes all of the tips you need (at first glance)
- Googled because it was the most accessible way to figure out his needs, doesn’t really hear people talk about specific websites that are good for music learning

### Learning a song

- Would use a phone to find sheet music, as he does not have a bigger screen (like tablet) accessible to him
- On YouTube, would come across a specific song he is interested in, looks through description
- Often uses Musescore as well, most popular, and first thing that pops up
- (laptop ran out of battery)
- On small phone screen, would try his best to learn the song
- Skims over the music and checks if there’s anything that catches his eye, what seems out of place
- Song is pretty simple, but if had questions about symbols, would search online what the symbol means
- Having a small screen, would have to stop playing and scroll down
- A good feature to have would be for it to automatically scroll to your own tempo, and saves paper
- Scrolling is definitely cumbersome and ruins the atmosphere
- The quickest and easiest thing to do is use musescore (large database of sheets)
- Does not have a printer, but if he had one, he would print out the music so that it would be easier to read
- Spends an hour a day learning
- Satisfied because musescore has everything he needs, except the scrolling bugs him
- Knows he mastered it when he memorizes the notes and plays it without stuttering
- Has not looked into finding other websites
- Musescore is most up to date and simple and has most things you are looking for

### Post-activity

- Often records, because when playing, you miss/don’t notice areas that sound odd
- Writes on the actual sheet music, not separate notes
- It would be helpful to be able to write the sheet music on Musescore, because without it, it would take longer to memorize
    - Does Musecore need it? Yes, it is very helpful, probably takes 4x longer to master the tip you did not write on the sheet music

### Follow-up questions

- Finding a website is the hardest, because no one talks about it in daily life
- Haven’t had problems when learning music, maybe instrument accessibility for other people
- Telling fingering ways would be helpful, musescore does not have fingerings so you would have to figure it out yourself
- Currently does not seek social activities for music learning, but in the past it was mostly recitals, where most people don’t have that accessible to them
- Music learning experience that took long: too much going on in the music, but repetitive practice will help
- If makes mistake, would focus on that and repeat it until he masters it
- Not using internet: came across piano teacher through connections, which a lot of people don’t have. Piano teacher provided him with a lot of things he did not have to find for himself

### Wrap-up

- Ability to slow down time, playing slower for a difficult part
- Nevermind
- Ability to write on the sheet music on musescore, pages that turn automatically for you
- Any sort of tips on common hard spots
