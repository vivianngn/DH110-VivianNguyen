67
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.570
Interviewee: I, this is the only instrument I use right now, and only I use it.

73
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.870
Interviewee: An hour predict.

74
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:38.220
Interviewee: But now it's probably be like an hour recently would be like an hour approach week i'd say.

75
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:53.460
Vivian Nguyen: Okay, so I want to like a more specific set of questions.

76
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:02.910
Vivian Nguyen: How often like throughout your daily life, to set aside time to learn a musical instrument or a new song.

77
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:13.170
Interviewee: um maybe like I said the weekend we'd like to this to learn a new song.

78
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.370
Interviewee: And last round.

79
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:45.630
Vivian Nguyen: Work for you, and do you like how successful looking at like specific sheet music to play, or when you want to figure out what something means.

80
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:54.060
Interviewee: i'm regarding the sheet music, I would say it is half.

81
00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:13.500
Interviewee: X, accessible and have an accessible simple because the main website where you can shoot music music score is a little you typically have to I think pay for some of them i'm not sure I haven't really done that.

82
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.670
But.

83
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:33.450
Interviewee: There, there are some websites there, we can get free sheet music i'd say that, looking at sheet music like typically new ones that you haven't seen before, on your phone or whatever device they're using is a little hard to read and I feel like.

84
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.820
Interviewee: It could be better in that sense, on learning new music.

85
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.950
Vivian Nguyen: What kind of about this, do you usually use for the.

86
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:53.970
Vivian Nguyen: instrument and songwriting process and what kind of information or tools you.

87
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:56.640
Vivian Nguyen: need.

88
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.250
Interviewee: Other than repetitive practice.

89
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.330
Interviewee: I would say, a.

90
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.290
Interviewee: teacher is is.

91
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.330
Interviewee: Pretty helpful.

92
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.500
Interviewee: Especially when you don't have that much experience.

93
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.250
Interviewee: and insight instrument and.

94
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.970
Interviewee: Other than YouTube.

95
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:32.760
Interviewee: i'd say yeah definitely a teacher definitely teach you they can show you live in person.

96
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:43.260
Interviewee: or over call to tell you, like Okay, this is what you should do in the instant rather than you having to figure out your own mistakes.

97
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.590
Interviewee: yeah.

98
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.940
Vivian Nguyen: Okay.

99
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.910
Vivian Nguyen: So, which resources, which is useless.

100
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.900
Interviewee: To find fine sheet music or, just like in general.

101
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.090
Vivian Nguyen: For like.

102
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:11.790
Vivian Nguyen: instrument learning and she said.

103
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:17.970
Interviewee: I would say.

104
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:26.460
Interviewee: counts, I take YouTube because they usually have the sheet music that they use in the description.

105
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:32.700
Interviewee: And also it's like a live demonstration of how us on this meant to be played.

106
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:34.590
as well.

107
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:48.720
Vivian Nguyen: come to realize that you could use YouTube to I guess like help you in this music learning process.

108
00:12:49.530 --> 00:13:02.610
Interviewee: And it was like I didn't really know what else to do um I just I realized that there are people who produce their own sheet music for free.

109
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.190
Interviewee: and

110
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:18.660
Interviewee: And it was just like this is pretty convenient i'd say when i'm trying to find a live demonstration of our song, this was to be played and finding new sheet music accessible.

111
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.650
Vivian Nguyen: Accessible she is.

112
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.020
Interviewee: That is, that is where I can, that of which I can print out.

113
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.270
Interviewee: Yes.

114
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.220
Vivian Nguyen: So.

115
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.400
Vivian Nguyen: Do you ever use like Apps or websites to learn music, I know, like guitar tabs it's very.

116
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.420
Interviewee: na part particularly.

117
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:53.730
Vivian Nguyen: I see.

118
00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:00.720
Vivian Nguyen: um do you read forums, if I answers for your like.

119
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.200
Vivian Nguyen: musical instrument learning related questions.

120
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.440
Interviewee: um sometimes I think.

121
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:09.510
Interviewee: Three to on.

122
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.740
Interviewee: brother I don't know the specific.

123
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:26.400
Interviewee: group, but they typically like tell you how, when I had trouble finding my fingering on my own for a music it be like I tend to read it, or like.

124
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:41.310
Interviewee: The most like optimal way to play a specific song simple because let's say, like the the the chord progression is too big for your hand and beaches, they tell you a more efficient way or more optimal way, if you have smaller hands.

125
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.000
Interviewee: to play that specific music.

126
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:50.820
Vivian Nguyen: Okay.

127
00:14:52.800 --> 00:15:00.780
Vivian Nguyen: So what the methods that you mentioned, what do you do to get inspired and what motivates you to learn and practice new music.

128
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.090
Interviewee: Mostly just.

129
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:12.600
Interviewee: i'd say like 5% of it is like a social thing and then the rest of it, I just do for myself, I think that.

130
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:22.650
Interviewee: I just i'd come across a song that sounds pretty Nice and be like yeah I want to try playing it, I want to try producing the same.

131
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.280
Interviewee: Sound maybe I guess you take.

132
00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:43.890
Interviewee: Online on my own and when when I completely mastered a song I can feel proud of myself and I think that it sounds really nice I can make the music sound how I want it to sound like if I think that.

133
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:57.660
Interviewee: Like a different iteration of the music played differently would sound better to that and, just like a little bit of experimentation some times.

134
00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.070
I see.

135
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:10.290
Vivian Nguyen: So, in your view, what is the most useful source of information for music, I know you mentioned YouTube but.

136
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.380
Vivian Nguyen: most useful source of influential.

137
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:23.550
Interviewee: As I am not really.

138
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:43.560
Interviewee: Because I can have to go through the process of actually learning the music instrument on my own, I always had a teacher there with me I don't think I really had any other website or learning APP.

139
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:52.830
Interviewee: That I use set up simple because my teacher only recommended me YouTube and honestly, this is like this is the.

140
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:56.370
Interviewee: most efficient way.

141
00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.400
Interviewee: it's like watch them play.

142
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:00.960
Interviewee: yeah.

143
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:07.590
Vivian Nguyen: Okay, thank you.

Interviewee: knowledge.

214
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:13.650
Interviewee: Because it's been around for so long, usually there are people with the same questions in the past and.

215
00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:18.390
Interviewee: If there's like a pretty like small question I would say.

216
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:26.820
Interviewee: Because of how long it's been out for this probably someone who has answered your question or.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.190
Interviewee: or whatever you need thinking mean.

218
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:40.050

225
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.740

226
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:48.900
Interviewee: searching online there are forums for this said damn However I realized that a more efficient way, I guess, you could say, is a forum specifically dedicated to.

227
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.630
Interviewee: Learning or answering any of your questions also.

228
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:03.420
Interviewee: I think that there are like also videos on different.

229
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:07.950
Interviewee: websites that are designed for you to learn are.

230
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:16.020
Interviewee: Sometimes a little too long, so I realized that simply just reading would be faster.

231
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:17.820
Interviewee: as well.

232
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.660
Interviewee: If a video is too often I will typically.

233
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.460
Interviewee: skip over.

237
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.920
Interviewee: About 30 minutes I just read a little bit.

238
00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:01.980
Interviewee: I don't think I have any clothes, but that's simply because.

239
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:04.440
Interviewee: I just.

240
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:18.000
Interviewee: I just I just typically all the questions i've had because it's been around for so long, already there, so I don't I don't really have to post.

241
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.380
Vivian Nguyen: Would you ever see yourself posting.

242
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.060
uh.

243
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.060

244
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.770

245
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.660

Interviewee: i'm.

247
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:54.480
Interviewee: Typically, I I didn't have to post, because I would just go through the mentoring process.

248
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:02.700
Interviewee: I actually I have posted once and then someone someone answered.

249
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.130
Interviewee: Specific like.

250
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:14.370
Interviewee: If if this the man or if this happen, or if this happens, then you typically do this this or this and it's mostly like it's like a logical.

251
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:18.450
Interviewee: logical way of saying call.

252
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.640
Interviewee: they've told me a logical way of.

253
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:29.490
Interviewee: going through a specific situation and in the game.

254
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:32.790
Vivian Nguyen: interesting.

255
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.850
Vivian Nguyen: Are you satisfied with the method you used for this activity and.

256
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.440
Vivian Nguyen: How do you decide if you like, mastered what you want to learn.

257
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:50.460
Interviewee: How do I decide what I mastered.

258
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:53.010
Interviewee: Or if i've mastered.

259
00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:54.300
Vivian Nguyen: Yes, if you mastered.

260
00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:56.970
Interviewee: So typically.

261
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.770
Interviewee: If you repeat the first part of the question.

262
00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.770
Vivian Nguyen: Are you satisfied with the method you use for this activity.

263
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:15.150
Interviewee: Yes, I would say that I am satisfied.

264
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.630
Interviewee: Simply because it's.

265
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:33.090
Interviewee: Like I do end up learning and I do come out with a positive result, I did get what I wanted, and then I would apply it in the actual game and then.

266
00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:49.290
Interviewee: And then also regarding if i've mastered simply because it is a competitive game on the higher ranks there you go the more that you improve, you will see.

267
00:30:50.850 --> 00:31:12.210
Interviewee: numbers to display how much you, you have improved, and the more you play the more it'll show your average set of skill and once you have reached a high enough i'm reading I guess you could say, then you could say that, like yes, I have mastered at what I am doing.

268
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.190
Vivian Nguyen: Okay um.

269
00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:31.800
Vivian Nguyen: I guess like, why did you choose um read it, and by the same to you.

270
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:34.710
Interviewee: um.

271
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.800
Interviewee: It looks like there are other websites.

272
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.260
Interviewee: To.

273
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:45.960
Interviewee: Better yourself, I guess, you could say like.

274
00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:53.730
Interviewee: like this one, this website it's a.

275
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:56.820
Interviewee: template because.

276
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:09.330
Interviewee: it's a it's a little more confusing I guess you could say it's it's not as in depth as i'd like regarding.

277
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:13.260
Interviewee: Like.

278
00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:21.720
Interviewee: let's say, for example in this in this subreddit there are they go pretty in depth and.

279
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:34.530
Interviewee: It like maps out every single situation that you could possibly be are like most of the situations, you could possibly be in but for this one it's mostly it's a little the ui is a little harder to use.

280
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.750
Interviewee: there's also like.

281
00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:45.990
Interviewee: it's like it's not it doesn't tell you like.

282
00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:56.430
Interviewee: It just tell it just tells you like the top layer of things and that's typically how it goes with a lot of the websites.

283
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:15.510
Interviewee: And I found that read it, you know I just because, like you, you're you're you're searching the questions that the muscle of the websites don't really have a search function for typical like form questions on so I found that just.

284
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.150
Interviewee: Just just using the suburb is the most optimal way.

285
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:24.570
Vivian Nguyen: interesting.

286
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.140
Interviewee: All and I would say, like the.

287
00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:30.180
Vivian Nguyen: design.

288
00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:39.210
Interviewee: is pretty pretty simple it's easy to understand, rather than having to go through like let's say this website, we have to explore, you have to try to find out.

289
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:50.400
Interviewee: If the try to find out what what everything means, and I think that sometimes it is a little too much for people who don't understand what's going on.

290
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:56.280
Interviewee: It could be better, and this is typically how it goes for most of the websites.

291
00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:02.850
Vivian Nguyen: Interesting that you find the website like it's harder to use.

292
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.310
Vivian Nguyen: then read it.

293
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:19.830
Vivian Nguyen: Okay, so now i'm going to like move on and I will not ask you to demonstrate so activities on.

294
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:27.360
Vivian Nguyen: To step two activities that are more music learning related and the first one would be.

295
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:46.380
Vivian Nguyen: About like learning or brushing up on your skills in an instrument, and the second one is learning a new song on a particular instrument of choice, so let's do that, and when you're doing these tasks use whatever websites and toys and you lead us, and please think aloud.

296
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:59.940
Vivian Nguyen: So yeah the first task can you show me how you would go about finding resources on learning or brushing up on your skills in a musical instrument.

297
00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:11.310
Interviewee: So you are like brushing I typically just use music score.

298
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.550
Interviewee: Right now, as this.

299
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.510
Interviewee: is like the best way currently if i'm just like off the top my head.

300
00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:35.010
Interviewee: i'd say that having the ability to let's say like.

301
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:51.090
Interviewee: Having the ability to like see the song played out, but in a robotic manner is a useful i'd say are there could be improvements but.

302
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:55.830
Vivian Nguyen: Would you say that new score helps you learn an instrument so.

303
00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:59.940
Vivian Nguyen: Oh, wanted to learn violin again give me a score.

304
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.470
Interviewee: No, no, used to be a school.

305
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:06.660
Interviewee: If I want to learn violin again, I think I just.

306
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.990
Interviewee: The first seven things that product is just like.

307
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:21.030
Interviewee: The basics of learning violent.

308
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:25.950
Interviewee: On and then I probably watch.

309
00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:29.820
Interviewee: A shorter video on.

310
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.860
Interviewee: I probably I probably watched like it felt like a.

311
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:47.850
Interviewee: Like a like a pact video short video if I know that learning the violin is last step, so it looks like the first episode, as you can see.

312
00:36:49.800 --> 00:37:01.470
Interviewee: Put the layout it tells you all the all the basics at the bottom now let's say like oh no the the proper way to hold the violin shoulder as a stream all the different strings.

313
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:15.090
Interviewee: Other rather than this one where it's just like less than one Tony i'm less inclined to click it simply because it's 12 minutes long and only shows you how to hold the violin and.

314
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.750
Interviewee: And then, so I probably watch the video and then.

315
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:28.260
Interviewee: If i'm still interested I probably scroll down, maybe now would be how but this one, probably this one and.

316
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:33.060
Interviewee: This one was pretty interesting it's pretty simple it looks like.

317
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:42.420
Interviewee: It has all the basics out of need and when i'm trying to learn a new one i'm trying to rewind violin as well.

318
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:59.580
Interviewee: And then yeah it looks like the sort of Sub site looks like it has everything like an faq the type of type of thing when i'm trying to learn the violent again and that's typically typically do.

319
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:10.050
Interviewee: As I currently I feel like if I there are not many like resources that I know that can help me, I would say.

320
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:18.210
Vivian Nguyen: I see.

321
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:27.240
Vivian Nguyen: What it looks like violent online has a ton of articles on different things, so I think.

322
00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:30.090
Vivian Nguyen: it's pretty.

323
00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:32.790
Vivian Nguyen: informative.

324
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:35.880
Vivian Nguyen: Yes, yes um.

325
00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:40.140
Vivian Nguyen: How did you decide what method to use.

326
00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.310
Interviewee: Just a Google search function is the easiest.

327
00:38:45.480 --> 00:39:00.360
Interviewee: Whatever came up that cat caught my eye like let's say, for example, the YouTube video, it would be like seeing how the length of the video, it will also show the sub sections.

328
00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:11.040
Interviewee: Basically, to see if the video is pretty simple to find out if there is a video I was actually looking for and then.

329
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:20.820
Interviewee: By one I like I want to learn more of more like in depth way I scroll down to seal website, the catch my eye.

330
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:25.500
Interviewee: Like the other one was wiki how pulling up with the House and blue because.

331
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.100
Interviewee: it's not like.

332
00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:37.770
Interviewee: That it's not it's not what i'm looking for I guess you know i'm not really sure why it, I just want something a little more.

333
00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:48.480
Interviewee: website dedicated to an instrument learning or an instrument i'd say and then going to this website, it looks like.

334
00:39:51.030 --> 00:40:02.580
Interviewee: I think I think that could be better about this website, simply because it only has pictures, maybe like a short video on how like it comes into that position or.

335
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:20.850
Interviewee: Short video on just like explain, or like a one to two minute video explain everything that's going on here could be implemented, however, I do think that the pictures are very necessary when you're trying to learn the new instrument.

336
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.140
Vivian Nguyen: See.

337
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:35.340
Vivian Nguyen: I guess like how much time would you spend a day learning an instrument like through this method.

338
00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:40.350
Interviewee: I think that in the beginning, it definitely takes a little longer.

339
00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:44.400
Interviewee: Just from my experience so probably take like.

340
00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:51.030
Interviewee: Two hours a day for me to be comfortable with where i'm at especially.

341
00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:56.040
Interviewee: Since it does take a little longer for me to learn, I think.

342
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:07.710
Vivian Nguyen: Okay, and are you satisfied with like the videos and website you encountered.

343
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.830
Vivian Nguyen: And how do you decide if you mastered like.

344
00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.500
Vivian Nguyen: The violin or how would you like how.

345
00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:16.230
Vivian Nguyen: Do you evaluate.

346
00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:20.070
Interviewee: I would evaluate the by.

347
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:28.080
Interviewee: Just killing my comfort ability of whatever like whatever task i'm trying to do.

348
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:39.720
Interviewee: I figured that I am pretty satisfied with this method, simply because I don't really have a way to.

349
00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:47.550
Interviewee: If i'm trying to sell flooring I don't really have any other real methods it's not really talked about.

350
00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.080
Interviewee: You kind of just do this thing on your own.

351
00:41:56.610 --> 00:42:00.450
Interviewee: i'm not sure if I have any other other thing.

352
00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.940
Vivian Nguyen: And the first part of the question was.

353
00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:03.720
Vivian Nguyen: Are you satisfied.

354
00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:09.240
Vivian Nguyen: satisfied with this website, I am satisfied with this website.

355
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:15.660
Interviewee: On simply because it has all the tips that you might need it also has.

356
00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:25.650
Interviewee: All most or all the information as I can't really tell right now, but it looks like it has all the information that you need.

357
00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.440
Interviewee: to learn the new.

358
00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.370
Interviewee: The new the new the new instrument setting.

359
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:45.960
Vivian Nguyen: Okay, so why did you choose like googling and why did you think that's a good idea.

360
00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:56.100
Interviewee: it's the most accessible way to try and figure out your whatever needs that you may need.

361
00:42:58.530 --> 00:42:59.490
Interviewee: it's not like.

362
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:07.680
Interviewee: Everyone is talking about like oh this this specific website is good for.

363
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:10.740
Interviewee: Music learning or instrument learning.

364
00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:14.850
Interviewee: Just like.

365
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:22.260
Interviewee: It has it has everything they you'd probably want.

366
00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:30.990
Interviewee: You just use keep keep skimming through the searches and, eventually, you will probably find what you're looking for.

367
00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:39.630
Vivian Nguyen: Okay, well, thank you for showing me how you perform this task.

368
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:47.310
Vivian Nguyen: The next one is more about learning a song, so how would you go about learning a new song.

369
00:43:48.360 --> 00:44:01.140
Vivian Nguyen: for finding the sheet music or like from finding out what you want to learn and finding the sheet music to learning it to its fullest and preferably an instrument that you ready, so the piano.

370
00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:02.760
Interviewee: Okay.

371
00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:04.170
um.

372
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.380
Interviewee: So typically I.

373
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:20.040
Interviewee: use my phone, unfortunately, as I don't have really like an iPad or like a bigger screen accessible to me right now um.

374
00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.940
Interviewee: And then I just use.

375
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:26.550
Interviewee: Like.

376
00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.210
Interviewee: On on YouTube I come across like.

377
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:33.720
Interviewee: A specific like.

378
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:39.240
Interviewee: A specific song that I i'm interested in and then.

379
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:48.150
Interviewee: I typically look through the description of it see if I can find anything regarding where I could find the sheet music.

380
00:44:51.750 --> 00:45:11.610
Interviewee: oftentimes I will find myself using music score as well i'm simply because it's the most it's The first thing is the most popular one, and I feel like there are many different iterations of the sets to music the Channel and, and so I will.

381
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:19.860
Interviewee: The will.

382
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.310
Interviewee: Just like so typically I just like.

383
00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:34.140
Interviewee: let's say right here on be like okay i'm interested.

384
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.420
Interviewee: Okay, so after.

385
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:38.280
Interviewee: After like figure out the song, I want to play i'll just.

386
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:46.050
Interviewee: On this on this small small screen, I will try my best to learn.

387
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.550
Interviewee: Just by having whatever I have.

388
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:02.190
Interviewee: And so i'm just like okay so i'll skim over asked him over the music i'll see it like this any sort of.

389
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:16.500
Interviewee: Things that catch my eye I look at look at the key signature I look at the entire music, if anything, seems out of place, but it looks like the song is pretty.

390
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:23.040
Interviewee: Pretty pretty pretty simple and in the rhythm sounds in a.

391
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:35.970
Interviewee: yeah and a rhythm sense there's not there's no like key abnormalities or any sort of symbols that might not i'm not I might not understand if I did have any.

392
00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:48.900
Interviewee: Any questions about understanding the simple or understand music I probably just search online, just like a general description of what the symbol is or like um I probably also just.

393
00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:52.920
Interviewee: click on the music score.

394
00:47:55.290 --> 00:48:05.070
Interviewee: The belt plate, since the since the last time we'll play the music for you, I could see like Okay, this is, this is probably what it means, if I can, if I listen, listen to the song.

395
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:07.260
Interviewee: So I will.

396
00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.020
Interviewee: Look at the music i'll.

397
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:19.710
Interviewee: Have a picture in my head like what's probably supposed to sound like and then I will end the point real quick.

398
00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:35.820
Interviewee: So I look bad things about having a small screen is having to scroll down every line.

399
00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:47.490
Interviewee: which I do find a little irritating I think that maybe if you do have a small screen, one of the things that could be implemented is playing at your own temple and the screen will automatically scroll down for you.

400
00:48:47.880 --> 00:49:06.690
Interviewee: In in a set temple so it will follow, along with where you're at as well, and I think that that is also will help you keep the hope you keep yourself rhythmically in check, we show, all in all else will be a very enlightening, I think, and then, so you just get.

401
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:35.490
Interviewee: And then that's typically how I would play the song and I keep playing it repetitively until I feel like I don't have to pause or during the song or I don't have to like i'm just like studying i'd say.

402
00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:43.440
Vivian Nguyen: I see, would you say, like the scrolling process is kind of like cumbersome and.

403
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:48.690
Vivian Nguyen: Like as opposed to like paper she means that you can have it all laid out in front of you.

404
00:49:48.960 --> 00:50:00.060
Interviewee: Yes, yes, this is um I also feel like if if it did have like that's rolling function in the temple it also saves paper for you and.

405
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.460
Interviewee: it's also like.

406
00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:10.380
Interviewee: it's it's tedious to do and it ruins the whole atmosphere, they trying to create when playing music.

407
00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:23.520
Vivian Nguyen: So, how did you decide what matters to you.

408
00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:25.650
Interviewee: i'm.

409
00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:26.460
Just.

410
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:42.270
Interviewee: Like a quick quick quick the quickest and easiest thing to do is just to use new score if I if I really wanted to find a better website i'm sure that I could i'm.

411
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:52.710
Interviewee: New score just has like the notes out there, I think that if you're trying to like find a PDF or it's like the typical you'll find a PDF version of.

412
00:50:53.190 --> 00:51:04.230
Interviewee: Music, but it ends up a little too small, simply because they photocopy it it's on older website, just for the top of the music and Plus, you have to zoom in a lot more.

413
00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:15.000
Interviewee: And they'll have you know how the scrolling lot more as well, and also like if you don't have a printer available to like this is the most, this is the easiest thing to do.

414
00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:22.080
Vivian Nguyen: I see, so you don't have a printer.

415
00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:23.070
Currently.

416
00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.080
Interviewee: Otherwise I would try to print out the music.

417
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:49.590
Vivian Nguyen: How much time would you spend a day learning a song in this like not that.

418
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:57.360
Interviewee: I would say, like an hour, simply because learning a song will take longer a lot longer than actual.

419
00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:05.790
Interviewee: going through going through the song one time will take significantly longer than just like.

420
00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:15.690
Interviewee: Once you've like be super comfortable level, so I probably take like if I lose track of myself I probably take two hours but, on average, I will usually take one hour i'd say.

421
00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:21.030
Interviewee: Well, for multiple days like three days in a row.

422
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.150
Vivian Nguyen: I see I see um.

423
00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.620
Vivian Nguyen: Are you satisfied with the method is for this activity and.

424
00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:37.530
Vivian Nguyen: Like in this context, have.

425
00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:41.040
Vivian Nguyen: How do you decide if you mastered that song.

426
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.020
Interviewee: um.

427
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.050
Interviewee: I would say that i'm satisfied simply because.

428
00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:48.510
Interviewee: It has mostly everything I need.

429
00:52:50.070 --> 00:53:02.070
Interviewee: I don't think that, like, I do think that the the schooling of this game to those bugged me a little bit, but there's nothing that I can really do about it right now.

430
00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:08.430
Interviewee: And as we're mastering the music once i've stopped playing.

431
00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:25.020
Interviewee: Once i've stopped like stuttering and pausing during the music want to reach like a comfort of like kind of like when you when you've mastered music it's like you matt you like kind of memorize the notes what comes next.

432
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:33.180
Interviewee: And it's like and then i'll feel like that, yes.

433
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:39.480
Vivian Nguyen: I see Thank you um.

434
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:48.330
Vivian Nguyen: And I see why did you choose to use mustache and why is it good.

435
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.990
Interviewee: Or why Why did I choose.

436
00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:52.920
Interviewee: means that.

437
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:56.100
Vivian Nguyen: Now I feel good, like other.

438
00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:59.220
Vivian Nguyen: options.

439
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:01.380
Interviewee: um.

440
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:03.480
Interviewee: I just I just.

441
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:16.080
Interviewee: I don't think i've really like looked into finding a much better website, this is like typically, in my opinion, the most.

442
00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:33.900
Interviewee: Up to date way to learn the music i'd say are like finding new music, it has all different, all the different people trying to create their own sheet music for the song how they interpret it and then.

443
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:38.790
Interviewee: yeah that's.

444
00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:47.490
Interviewee: that's what it's it's pretty simple it has everything you're looking for regarding like um how song should be played how.

445
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:54.060
Interviewee: Just like how it sounds i'm or like.

446
00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:00.690
Interviewee: On that's that's about it it's pretty pretty simple simple simple thing to do.

447
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:11.340
Vivian Nguyen: Okay, so now i'm going to move on to more general questions.

448
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:16.920
Vivian Nguyen: So do you ever record your music learning and, if so, how do you documented.

449
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:19.380
Interviewee: I.

450
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.340
Interviewee: In the past I have recorded myself i'm.

451
00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.660
Interviewee: Playing other than like.

452
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:32.760
Interviewee: When I do record I typically want to.

453
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:40.560
Interviewee: Watch I play if i'm making any mistakes or if this sounds weird because, like when you're playing you often miss some things that you're trying to.

454
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.260
Interviewee: That made the optimist things that that sounds a little weird.

455
00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.610
Interviewee: If anything, I will.

456
00:55:51.930 --> 00:56:03.990
Interviewee: I may not document it on a piece of paper on actually I will document on that sheet music like hey okay like just like a reminder, when I come across this again like just reminder like Okay, this is like a G sharp or like.

457
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:10.440
Interviewee: You played this this throng know so I just like market on top like this is just like a T shirt or something.

458
00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:13.560
Interviewee: And it's typically typically how it goes.

459
00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.250
Vivian Nguyen: They see.

460
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:21.180
Vivian Nguyen: That makes sense.

461
00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.340
Vivian Nguyen: So you don't have like written notes, or do you have any written notes.

462
00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:27.840
Interviewee: I don't.

463
00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:30.690
Interviewee: Particularly have any way to note, I would say that, like.

464
00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:41.190
Interviewee: Just like writing on the actual on the actual like music, I found this just like like simple life meant like simple, I can see.

465
00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:50.760
Interviewee: That I would have like markings on like a This is like like I feel scribble as like a like scribble to make this seem like Okay, this is becoming slower.

466
00:56:51.330 --> 00:57:00.720
Interviewee: I put like a even though it's not stated in the music I figured that like if I put like a D Christians are like a crescendo it would be like a.

467
00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:19.110
Interviewee: It would sound better, even though it's not implemented in the actual music as well, sometimes, if I have if i'm confused about rhythm I put one and two and three and four, and just so like I can like find a better if I like just like and like match the notes with the rhythm i'd say.

468
00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:25.230
Vivian Nguyen: You brought up an interesting point about like writing on your sheet music.

469
00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:34.110
Vivian Nguyen: When you're learning your song earlier on, Miss score you did not or you're not able to.

470
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:37.320
Vivian Nguyen: Particularly right on that sheet is a great.

471
00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:39.750
Vivian Nguyen: If you think that would be like a helpful thing.

472
00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:44.640
Interviewee: I think that would be an extremely helpful thing to have when you're.

473
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:49.170
Interviewee: On your way yes.

474
00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:58.350
Interviewee: Just so like you will probably forget, you know when you're learning the song or when you're playing to the song again.

475
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:07.740
Interviewee: And it'll it'll take longer for you to to to to really put that like integrate it into your memory.

476
00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:19.320
Vivian Nguyen: Do you think that's like a feature that music or needs.

477
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.760
Interviewee: yeah I would say that it's something that you would.

478
00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:25.080
muscadines.

479
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:30.210
Interviewee: Because i'm like what's it like you're living harder song.

480
00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:42.120
Interviewee: it's not like you, will you will see there's just so much going on your mind like when you come across it again it's probably not going to be the first week and good.

481
00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:53.580
Interviewee: And so you probably have to play it again and play it again like until like it definitely takes like four times as long to fully master the mistake the thing you might have made or.

482
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:58.860
Interviewee: Really, remember, like okay this part gets thought or this person gets softer even though sustaining sheet music.

483
00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:15.810
Vivian Nguyen: Okay, so look.

484
00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:19.980
Vivian Nguyen: Like so now we're going to move on to like the.

485
00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.540
Vivian Nguyen: Activity questions.

486
00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:32.190
Vivian Nguyen: So what is the most difficult or what was the most difficult part of trying to find these resources.

487
00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:33.900
Interviewee: i'm.

488
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.740
Just like.

489
00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:48.720
Interviewee: i'm the most difficult part of not having any like real like prior knowledge, simply because the popularity of.

490
00:59:50.550 --> 01:00:04.170
Interviewee: websites that the help you learn I guess you can say no one really talks about it it's not really like a social thing so maybe like finding like the best website i'd say it's probably the hardest.

491
01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:16.200
Vivian Nguyen: One second.

492
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:35.880
Vivian Nguyen: Okay, so tell me, have you ever had any problems with learning music.

493
01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:40.830
Interviewee: Have any ever had any problems.

494
01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:44.910
Interviewee: Other than like your typical mistakes.

495
01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:48.150
Vivian Nguyen: yeah other than like mistakes.

496
01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:49.860
um.

497
01:00:53.640 --> 01:01:01.320
Interviewee: I haven't had any problems that i'd say maybe like a typical problem would be like instrument accessibility.

498
01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.400
Interviewee: Is is definitely one of the things.

499
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.580
Interviewee: That people might have.

500
01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:11.580
Interviewee: But, for me, I don't have any problems.

501
01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.370
Vivian Nguyen: yeah I do agree instrument accessibility, this really.

502
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:36.960
Vivian Nguyen: Is a problem yeah when I was learning clarinet in middle school band we I can't I come from, like a relatively poor family, so it was very hard to find a very affordable clarinet.

503
01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.390
Interviewee: yeah.

504
01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:43.230
Vivian Nguyen: So when I got a really cheap, one that didn't sound really good.

505
01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:50.280
Vivian Nguyen: yeah, so I think that also like affects your success in your music learning process to.

506
01:01:51.300 --> 01:02:01.920
Vivian Nguyen: next question is how'd you figure out if there are any of this, I have a better learning outcome than others like, are there any special tricks or techniques that they use on their.

507
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:04.380
Vivian Nguyen: To do.

508
01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:12.720
Vivian Nguyen: You could retain and they're like website, but what does it go to see i'm.

509
01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:17.190
Interviewee: Not i'm not sure I think the.

510
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:27.420
Interviewee: Regarding like muse score or choosing choosing to new score or like a PDF website, it would.

511
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:39.690
Interviewee: Definitely, be they definitely have their ups and downs are pros and cons like for the PDF website on there it's usually like fingering or like they'll tell you like how like how the song is meant to be played.

512
01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:55.680
Interviewee: Regarding your fingering choice, the most like optimal way, but that way, thus you won't like kind of your come across yourself i'm stuttering because, like Okay, like, I have to pause for like readjust and it was just like tell you like Okay, this is, like all right i'll just like show you.

513
01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:06.450
Interviewee: like this it's a smooth motion I guess you could say i'd rather on new score there's no fingerlings from from what i've come across there's no real fingerlings.

514
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:18.630
Interviewee: And so, if i'm like confused about something it won't really tell me the optimal way to put my hand on the keyboard unless I have to like pause and like think about like okay.

515
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:23.520
Interviewee: i'll probably have to put my hand I like something you know.

516
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:25.470
Vivian Nguyen: uh huh.

517
01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:33.840
Vivian Nguyen: Do you have any social activities such as forums or groups to learn or get inspiration from.

518
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.200
Vivian Nguyen: Currently, for like music, are you.

519
01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:44.250
Interviewee: Currently.

520
01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:57.870
Interviewee: Just like currently i'd say like it's mostly, just like the Games, they play, but in the in the past, it was mostly.

521
01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:03.870
Interviewee: In the past.

522
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.480
Interviewee: In the past that's mostly like.

523
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:13.590
Interviewee: I found myself at many recitals due to my piano teacher.

524
01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:22.560
Interviewee: I felt like most people don't really have that accessibility to like see other to play the song it really like.

525
01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:27.480
Interviewee: expands your world I guess you could say and.

526
01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:39.600
Interviewee: regards to like what you might want to play like okay this this person, you know play this song and it sounds really, really nice like I want to try playing it now, which has happened to be.

527
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:46.530
Interviewee: Like two times two or two or three times and I did end up playing and playing at the same recital playing the same song.

528
01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:51.060
Vivian Nguyen: interesting.

529
01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.640
Vivian Nguyen: Okay we're gonna move on to.

530
01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:58.830
Vivian Nguyen: Some different questions.

531
01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:03.690
Vivian Nguyen: Can you tell me about a music learning experience that took you a long time.

532
01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:06.270
Interviewee: Oh.

533
01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:13.320
Interviewee: The music learning experience, I would say, like this, just like.

534
01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:20.280
Interviewee: If I found a song really difficult or like because, like it's just so.

535
01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:28.830
Interviewee: That there's just like too much going on, it probably took me longer, but other than that I don't really have any like.

536
01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:33.900
Interviewee: Difficulties either it's just like just repetitive practice.

537
01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:41.040
Interviewee: and, eventually, you will you will then you eventually get to where you want to be.

538
01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:54.330
Vivian Nguyen: Okay, is there any method for music learning that you find yourself repeatedly doing.

539
01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:57.420
Interviewee: i'm.

540
01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:16.440
Interviewee: Like I will I will go back like if if I like make mistake and like I keep making mistakes, I will just focus on that subsection of music and just like play it from one point to a different point in that music and then, just like just keep practicing over and over again until I have.

541
01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:23.520
Interviewee: Political master like be comfortable with the was my without play.

542
01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:38.490
Vivian Nguyen: Okay, are there any kinds of music learning where you do not use the Internet and, if so, how did you learn like your instrument or your song.

543
01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:41.040
Interviewee: uh.

544
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:55.770
Interviewee: I would say that I came across my cancer to connections and I think that oftentimes people don't have that same connection with people, so I think what I had was pretty pretty rare.

545
01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:11.130
Interviewee: As she's not it's not like someone who posts themselves online post themselves online it's just like you know this person and you just like keep you just keep referring people to that that person.

546
01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:22.110
Vivian Nguyen: I see so mostly like through your piano teacher you got like the.

547
01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.010
Vivian Nguyen: Like the shoes that i'm seeing like in the background right.

548
01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:26.610
Yes.

549
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:31.320
Vivian Nguyen: that's all from your piano teacher and not from the Internet.

550
