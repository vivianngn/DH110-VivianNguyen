00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I see. is this the only instrument you use like at the moment?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And do you share this instrument with other people we're talking about the piano.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I this is the only instrument I use right now, and only I use it, I see.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And how much time per week do you play the piano currently, or in the best?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Oh, currently thank you both currently and in the past and hours.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Usually in the past. it'd be an hour per day but now it probably be like an hour recently.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:55.000
It'd be like an hour per week, etc. Okay, So I move on to like a more specific set of questions.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:04.000
How often, like throughout your daily life, do you set aside time to learn a musical instrument or a new song?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Maybe like i'd set off the weekend maybe like 2 days to learn a new song last the brown 2 h.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:40.000
How well does like a learning, set instrument or song work for you, and do usually.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:10:05.000
How successful looking at like specific sheet music to play or when you want to figure out what something mean recording the sheet music, I would say it is half accessible and half inaccessible, simple because the main website where you get she music music

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
score is a little you typically have to I think pay for some of them.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I'm not sure I haven't really done that but there!

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:32.000
There are some websites there where you can get free free music i'd say that looking at sheet music like typically new ones that you haven't seen before on your phone or whatever device that you're using is a little hard to

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:43.000
read, and I feel like it could be better in that sense on learning music, hierarchy.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000
What kind of methods do you usually use for the it's instrument and song learning process?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And what kind of information our tools to use need other than repetitive practice.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I would say a a teacher is is pretty helpful especially when you don't have family experience inside the instrument.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And other than Youtube that's it yeah definitely a teacher definitely a future.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:44.000
They can show you, live in person or over call to tell you like, Okay, this is what you should do in the instant, rather than you having to figure out your own mistakes.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:12:02.000
The Okay, So which resources would you say you use the most to find?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Sheet music, or just like in general, for like instruments learning, and she music, I would say, I don't know if this can.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I tell you, too, because they usually have the sheet music that they use in the description, and also it's like a live demonstration of how a song is meant to be played as Well, currently How did you like come to realize that

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.000
you could use Youtube to. I guess I help you in this music learning process.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:12.000
It was like I didn't really know what else to do I just I realized that there are people who produce their own sheet music for free A, and it was just like it was pretty convenient i'd say when i'm

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
trying to find a live demonstration of how song is supposed to be played in finding new shape.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Music, accessible students, accessible boy. that is, that is where I can, that of which I can print out.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So. Do you ever use like apps or websites to learn music?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:52.000
I know, like guitar tubes it's very common not particularly.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I see Do you read forums to find answers for your like musical instrument?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Learning related questions. Sometimes I think I would agree on it for the I don't know the specific group, but they typically like tell you how to when I had trouble finding my fingering on my own for of music.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:36.000
It'd be like I turn to reddit or like the most like optimal way to play a specific song, simply because, let's say, like the the chord progression is too big for your hand.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I'm gonna be just. they tell you a more efficient way or more optimal way.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:58.000
If you have smaller hands, play that specific music so with the methods that you mentioned, What do you do to get inspired?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And what motivates you to learn and practice new music mostly just, i'd say, like 5% of it is like a social thing.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And then the rest of it. I just do for myself. I think that I just I come across a song that sounds pretty nice and be like, Yeah, I I want to try playing it.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
I want to try producing the same mmm sound. maybe.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I guess you take my on my own, and when when I completely master a song I can feel proud of myself, and I think that it sounds really nice.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I could make the music sound. How I want it to sound like if I think that the like a different iteration of the music played differently, would sound better.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I do that, and just like a little bit of experimentation some at times.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:15.000
You, I see. so in your view, what is the most useful source of information for musically, I know you mentioned Youtube but this is the most useful source of information.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:39.000
As I am not really because I didn't have to go through the process of actually learning the music instrument on my own. I always had a teacher there with me.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I don't think I really had any other website or learning app that I used so.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Simply because my teacher only recommended me, Youtube and I was like, this is like this is the

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
This is the most efficient way I just like, watch them play.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And then, Yeah, okay, thank you. now we're gonna move on to some music learning activity.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:32.000
So right now. I would like to give you some time to think about a situation, or a time where you want to become more skilled at something which can be anything like getting better at a game or a school subject.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:40.000
How would you like go about finding resources on how to become more skilled at that thing that you're thinking about?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
I can use like any like websites, and think a lot as you do your test to your liking.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Think of an example something you would normally think about like becoming more skilled.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Okay, I guess you could say learning a new subject like in school.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:18.000
It would typically be my fourth. My first option would obviously search online.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Commissioner, do the do the screen. Yes, okay let's do I still it was too key.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:50.000
So what are you thinking about? What game do you want to get better it's okay.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:16.000
If you enable screen sharing a can you try? Okay.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:37.000
So first, I would typically like, let's say it would be for oh, this has to be a game that was as an example, just anything, anything anything.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Hmm. I think like easily when I have can do 15. that's it.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:21.000
So let's say like we watching typically if I wanted to get better to sit down.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
I would do if I had any specific questions like I wanted to.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.000
I wanted to learn how to better see are saying.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Typically, I learned that the best way through trial and error, to usually go on reddit and specifically like, separate.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:21:08.000
It called summer school. It would be typically answers. it's like the specific reddit answering all you all the questions in depth are pretty in depth, simply because, when when you're trying to find the answer to questions and

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:27.000
usually in my perspective. I want it to be in the sense as pretty like, actually. no, I when i'm looking for like an answer to something I usually like.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Skim through some skim through the comment section to see like if I am looking for, or if I find the quick answer, it should be pretty pretty short-ish, I would say, or like

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Usually the the comments I would like grab my attention, or the short ones that are concise.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:12.000
I want to make sure that I want to make sure, like There are also other comments verifying that credible, or seeing the credibility of a person statement as well.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:30.000
So it's like type this glute the comments are pretty pretty well most of the time, and so it's all usually end up everything.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:47.000
But usually i'll Skim through comments if they can gradually. i'll read it, and then it will then apply into the as well, and see like Hey, this really does work out or like, if anything so once I am done with this,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:23:00.000
and I realized that I can I learn they'll usually or it worked for a coach, or something.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Usually through this reddit. there are weekly sessions for people to get coaching from through.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Discussion file. I really see if you can see here a mentoring thread. It's usually like that's usually right.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:48.000
All the people sign up. you basically are public, basically play your information, and then or you or you find like a coach that and treats you.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
But typically you state the reason why or like you want to be.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000
You want to be coached, and then they will you will you'll meet with your own cook, and then once that is done.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:23.000
If I still have any questions, then usually it's just repetitive practice. and to you come and get it, I would say, and that is, and that's typically how it goes i'd say How interesting you can do a lot on this:

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:36.000
reddit celebrate it. Well, I guess, like you mentioned like Frederick earlier, too.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Do you think Ready is like a really good place to learn like more about something you want to get like more experience or skills.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:58.000
And yeah, I would say that it's pretty good at helping you I'd say simply because it's been around for so long.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:11.000
And it it's basically like the it's like a library library of knowledge, because it's been around for so long.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Usually there are people with the same questions, in the past and if it's like a pretty like small question, I would say, because of how long it's been out for this.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Probably someone who is answered your question, where or whatever needs that you may lose.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:47.000
And so what made you think about doing this task? Something that I would say that?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Well, what do you mean by something that makes me want to do this task like like It's it was just kind what I've done in the past?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Okay, and how did you decide what method to use? I do so.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Usually I would. I tried. I tried asking the advice for friends.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.000
I tried searching online. There are forums for this said game.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:54.000
However, I realize that a more efficient way I guess you could say It's a forum specifically dedicated to learning or answering a new of your questions.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Also I think that there are like also videos on different websites that are designed for you to learn are sometimes a little too long.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:32.000
So I realized, i'm simply just reading we'll do faster if a video is too long. then I will typically skip over. Okay, how much time would you spend on this task usually early.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
How much time would you spend on this specific subreddit?

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Learning things, and you like post at all mostly like i'd say it takes about 30 min.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:28:00.000
I just read a little bit, and I have I I don't think I have any close.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:17.000
But That's simply because I just I just I just typically all the collections I've had, because it's been around for so long already. there.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:26.000
So I Don't I don't really have to post Would you ever see yourself posting them?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Yeah, i'd say i'd see myself posting

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:56.000
I don't think other than requesting a mentor typically I didn't have to post because I would just go through the mentoring process. Hi!

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Oh, actually, I have posted once, and then someone someone answered specific like If if this statement, or if this happened, or if this happened, then you typically do this, this or this, and it's mostly like it's like a logical logical way

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:29.000
of seeing how I Dave, told me a logical way of going through a specific situation.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Interesting. Are you satisfied with the method you used for this activity?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
And how do you decide, if you like, mastered what you want to learn?

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:54.000
How do I decide what I mastered? or if I mastered?

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Yes, if you mustered so Tuesday. Sorry. Could you repeat the first part of the question?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Are you satisfied with the method you used for this activity?

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Yes, I would say the I am satisfied typically simply because it's I I do end up learning, and I do come out with a positive result.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:43.000
I did get what I I wanted, and then I would apply it index game, and then and then also regarding if I've mastered simply because it is a competitive game.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:31:08.000
The higher ranks that you go, the more that you improve you will see numbers to display how much you you have improved, and the more you play, the more it will show your average sort of skill. and once you have reached a high enough rating I guess you could say then you could

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:18.000
say that like Yes, I have. You mastered at what I am doing. Okay?

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:33.000
I guess, like why did you choose read it and Why, it seemed good to you.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:52.000
You're a virtue. it's like there are other websites. to better yourself, I guess you could say like like this one.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:04.000
This website and site simply because it's a it's a little more confusing.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:20.000
I guess you could say it's it's not as in-depth, as i'd like regarding like, let's say, for example, in this in this subreddit there are they go pretty

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:30.000
in-depth, and it like maps out every single situation that you could possibly be, or like most of the situations you could possibly be in.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
But for this one it's mostly it's a little the Ui is a little harder to use

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:56.000
There's also like it's like oh, it's not it doesn't tell you like they just tell it just tells you like the the top layer of things, and that's typically how it goes with a lot of the

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:12.000
websites, and I found that reddit you know I just because, like you, you're you're you're searching the questions, and just the the most of the websites don't really have a search function for typical like form

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:22.000
questions. So I found that just just just using separate the separative is the most optimal way.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Interesting. All I would say, like the the design is pretty pretty simple it's easy to understand. rather than having to go through like. Let's say this website where you have to explore you have to try to find out you have to try to

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:51.000
find out what what everything means. I think that sometimes it is a little too much for people who don't understand what's going on.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:02.000
It could be better. And this is typically how it goes for most of the websites interesting that you find the website like.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:22.000
It's harder to use and read it okay so Now, i'm going to like move on, and I will not ask you to demonstrate some activities on the so 2.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:35.000
So 2 activities that are more music learning related, and the first one would be about like learning or brushing up on your skills in an instrument, and the second one is learning.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:54.000
And you saw on a particular instrument of choice so let's do that. And when you're doing these tasks, use whatever websites and toys you'd literally use and please think aloud So yeah, the first task can you show

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:03.000
me how you would go about finding resources on learning or brushing up on your skills and a musical instrument, so no higher wheelchair.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:12.000
So for new or like pressing out, I typically just use museum score.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Right now as those that is like the best way if i'm just like off the top of my head.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:52.000
I'd say that having the ability to let's say like having the delete, so like see the song played out, but in a robotic manner is useful i'd say there could be improvements but would you

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
say that new score helps you learn an instrument.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
If you wanted to learn file, win again, would you use new score?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
No, I would not use musical. if I wanted to learn violin again.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:29.000
I think I just first set of things i'd probably do it's just like the basics of learning violent and and then I probably watch a shorter video.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:41.000
On. I probably I probably watch like a like a like a like a packed video.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Short video is, I know that learning about when there's a lot of steps. So it looks like the first episode as you can see with the layout.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
It tells you all the all the basics at the bottom now let's say like Oh, no!

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:13.000
The the proper way to hold the violin shoulder rest a screen all the different strings, other rather than this one where it's just like lesson one out 20 i'm less inclined to to click it simply because it's 12 min long and it

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
only shows you how to hold the violin and build, and then so I probably watch the video.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:28.000
And then if i'm still interested i'd probably scroll down, maybe not with the hell, but this one.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Probably this one sounds This one looks pretty interesting it's pretty simple.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:48.000
It looks like It has all the the basics I mean when i'm trying to learn a new when i'm trying to rewrite the violin as well. and then yeah, it looks like this so the subside looks like

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000
it has everything like an Fq. this type of type of thing.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:10.000
When i'm trying to learn the violin again. and that's typically typically how to do it, as I currently I feel like if I there are not many like resources that I know that can help me.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:23.000
I would say, I see. Well, it looks like violent online.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Has a ton of articles on different things so I think it's pretty informative.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Yes. So how did you decide what method to use? Just a Google search function is the easiest.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Whatever came up. that cat caught my eye. like let's say for example, the Youtube video.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:01.000
It would be like seeing how the like of the video. It would also show the subsections.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:10.000
And basically to see if the video is pretty simple to find out if that is the video I was actually looking for.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:17.000
And then, if I want but like I wanted to learn more of more like in depth way.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
I scroll down to see a website that catch my eye.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Like the other one was wiki ha probably not with the house and blue. because oh, it's not like that. that's not It's not what i'm looking for. I Guess you say no i'm not really sure

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:46.000
why it. I just want something a website dedicated to, and it to instrument learning or an instrument, i'd say.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:40:04.000
And then going to this website, it looks like, oh, I think a I think that could be better about this website simply because it only has pictures, maybe like a short video on how like it comes into that position or surf.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Video just like explain, or like a one to 2 min video explaining everything that that's going on here could be could be implemented.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
However, I do think that the pictures are very necessary when you're trying to learn the new mainstream.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:36.000
I guess, like. how much time would you spend a day learning an instrument like through this method?

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
I think that in the beginning it definitely takes a little longer.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Just from my experience. So I probably take like 2 h a day for me to be comfortable with where I met, especially since it does take a little longer.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:09.000
For me to learn, I I think. and are you satisfied with like the method, use, and the website you encountered?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:28.000
And what do you do? decide if you mastered like the violently, John? or how would you like? How I do evaluate that which is how I would evaluate that by just feeling my comfortability of whatever like whatever task i'm

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:40.000
trying to do I figured that I am pretty satisfied with this method simply because I don't really have a way 2.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:47.000
If i'm trying to self learning I don't really have any other real methods.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000
It's not really talked about you kind of just do this thing on your own.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:04.000
I'm not sure if I have any other other things and the first part of the question was, Are you satisfied?

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Yes, i'm satisfied with this website. i'd say i'm satisfied with this website.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Simply because it has all the tips that you might need it'll also pass.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Most, or all the information as I can't really tell right now, but it looks like it has all the information that you need to to learn the new.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:46.000
The news, the new, the new instrument setting. Okay, So why did you choose like Googling? And what did you think?

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:57.000
That was like a good idea. it's the most accessible way to try and figure out your whatever needs that you need.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:23.000
It's not like everyone is talking about like Oh, this this specific website is good for music, learning, or instrument learning just like it has It has everything that you you would probably want.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:32.000
You just you skip, keeps coming through the searches and if eventually you will probably find what you're looking for.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Mmm: Okay, Well, thank you for showing me how you perform this task.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:53.000
The next one is more about learning a song. So how would you go about learning a new song from finding the sheet music, or like from finding figuring out what you want to learn.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Then finding the sheet music to learning it to its fullest and preferably the instrument that you're reading.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:20.000
So European. Okay, so typically, I would use my phone unfortunately, as I don't have really like, and ipad or like a bigger screen accessible to me right now.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:38.000
And then I just use like on on Youtube I come across like a specific like a specific song that like i'm interested in.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:49.000
And then I typically look through the description of it. See if I can find anything regarding where I could find the sea music.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Awesome times I will find myself using muse score as well.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Simply because it's the most it's the first thing it's the most popular one, and I feel like there are many different iterations of the said she music that you're trying to learn and so I will it

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:47.000
will just like I so typically I just like so let's say that i'll do it on here.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Yes, ma'am. Okay. So after after I like figure out the song, I want to play, I i'll just on this on this small small screen.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:47:05.000
I will try my best to look just by having whatever I have and then. So i'm just like, okay, so i'll skim over. i'll skim over the music i'll see if like there's any sort of things that catch

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
my eye I look at, I look at the key signature.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:18.000
I look at the entire music, if anything seems out of place, but it looks like this song is pretty.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Pretty, pretty pretty simple, and in the in a rhythm sense in a and

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Yeah Yeah, in a rhythm sense there's not There's no like key abnormalities or any sort of symbols that might not.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:40.000
I might understand if I did have any questions about understanding a simple or understanding the music.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:47.000
I probably just search online, and just like a general description of what the symbol is, or like.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Probably also just click on the muse. score the the belts plate. since the since the website will play the music for you.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
I could see like, Okay, this is, this is probably what it means if I can.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:12.000
If I listen, listen to the song so I will look at the music i'll.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:20.000
I'll picture in my head like what's probably supposed to sound like, and then i'll end up pointing it was real quick.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:39.000
So Why, I love bad things about having a small screen is having to scroll down every line which I do find a little irritating.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:49.000
I think that maybe if you do have a small screen, one of the things that could be implemented is playing at your own temple, and the screen will automatically scroll down for you in a said Tempo.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:56.000
So it will follow along with where you're at as well and I think that that is also it will help you keep a help.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000
You keep yourself rhythmically in check, which all in all have.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:31.000
It'll be a better time learning I think and then So you just keep playing, and then that's typically how I would play the song, and I keep playing it repetitively until I feel like they don't have to pause or during the song

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:47.000
or I don't have to like just like study i'd Say, I see what you say like the scrolling process is kind of like cumbersome, and like as a hostile like paper sheet music.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
You can have it all like laid out in front of you.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Yes, yes, it is I also feel like if if it did have like that scrolling function in, said Temple, it would probably all.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:11.000
It also suits paper for you and Then it's also like it's tedious to do the whole atmosphere that you're trying to create when playing music.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Okay. So how did you decide what method to use? I just like a quick as the quick.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:49.000
It quick the quickest and easiest thing to do just to use me a score if I if I really wanted to fully find the buyer website, i'm sure you I could new score just has like the notes out there I think

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000
that if you're trying to like find a pdf for like you typically you'll find a pdf version of music.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
But it has up a little too small, simply because they photocopy.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:11.000
It it's an older website they'll just put a copy of the music, and thus you have to zoom in a lot more, and they'll have you a hobby scrolling a lot more as well and also like if you don't have

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:19.000
a printer available to you it's like this is the most This is the easiest thing to do, I see.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:29.000
So you don't have a printer available otherwise I would try to print out the music.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:50.000
How much time would you spend a day learning a song in this like method?

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:58.000
I would say like an hour, simply because learning a song will take longer, a lot longer than actual.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Going through going to the song one time will take significantly longer than just like once you've like reached a comfortable level, so i'd probably take like, if I lose track of myself i'd probably take 2 h, but on average,

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000
i'll usually take 1 h i'd say but for multiple days like 3 days in era.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:33.000
I see I see Are you satisfied with the method?

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Use for this activity and like in this context, have the How do you decide?

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:50.000
If he mastered that song. I would say that i'm satisfied, simple, because it has mostly everything that I need.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:59.000
But like I do think that the the scrolling of the screen, too, does bug me a little bit.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000
But there's nothing that I can really do about it right now,

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:16.000
And as for masking the music once i've stopped late once, I've stopped like stuttering and pausing during the music.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Once I reached like a comfort like kind of like when you when you master music it's like you math, you like kind of memorize the notes.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:34.000
What comes next, and it's like and then i'll feel like I've mastered this.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Yes, I see. thank you. And lastly, why did you choose to use musash?

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:53.000
And why is it good which had to be handsome? why why did I choose new stuff?

00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:00.000
And why does it seem good compared to like other options?

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:11.000
I just I don't think i've really like looked into finding a much better website.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:22.000
This is like typically, in my opinion, the most up-to-date way to learn the music.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:32.000
I'd say, for like finding new music it has all of different. all the different people trying to create their own sheet music for the song.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:42.000
How they interpret it and then, and yeah that's about that's what it's it's pretty simple.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:48.000
It has everything that you're looking for regarding like how songs should be played.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:55:00.000
How just like how it sounds. that's that's about it. it's a pretty pretty simple, simple simple thing.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:08.000
It's okay.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:18.000
So now i'm gonna move on to my dear what's all lucr, and if so, how do you document it?

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:29.000
I. In the past I have recorded myself playing other than like.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.000
When I do record, I typically want to watch how I play.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:43.000
If I make any mistakes or if this sounds weird because like when you're playing, you often miss some things that you're trying to

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000
That means you have to miss things that that sound a little weird.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:55.000
If anything, I will. I may not document it on a piece of paper on like.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Actually, I will document on the act of sheet music like, Hey?

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Okay, like, just like a reminder when I come across this again, like just remind you, like, Okay, this is like a G sharp or like you play This This is the wrong. No.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000
So I just like market on top like this it's just like a t-shirt or something.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:22.000
And I is typically typically how it goes they see there's a bunch of my media engineer that makes sense.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:27.000
So. yeah, So you don't have like written notes or do you have any written notes.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:37.000
I don't particularly have any written notes I would say that like just like writing on the actual actual like music.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:42.000
I found It's just like like simple way to find like simple like you can see there.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.000
I would have like markings i'm like Okay, This is like like, I feel scribble as like a like scribble to make this seem like okay.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:55.000
This is becoming slower. I put like a even though it's not stated in the music.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:14.000
I figured that like, if I put like a decryption or like a crescendo, it would be like a if i'm confused about rhythm, I put one and 2 and 3, and 4, and just so like I can like

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:20.000
find the better if I like. Just so I can like match the notes with the rhythm that's it.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:31.000
You're part of an interesting point about like writing on your sheet music when you're learning your song earlier on museum score.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:37.000
You did not, or you're not able to particularly write on that sheet music right?

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:46.000
If you think that would be like a helpful thing I think that would be an extremely helpful thing to have when you're

00:57:46.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Yes, facilitate you will probably forget you know when you're learning the song, or when you're playing do the song again, and it'll it'll take longer for you to really put that like integrate it into your memory

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:24.000
do you think that's like a feature that the muscore needs? yeah, I would say that it's something that you would.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:30.000
The me school needs because it's like let's say like you're looking a harder song.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:40.000
It's not like you will you will it's just so much good on your mind like when you come across it again.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:55.000
It's probably not going to be the first, thing they think of. And so you probably have to play it again and play it again like until, like it definitely takes like 4 times as long, to fully master the mistake that you might have made or really remember like Okay,

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.000
this part gets slaughtered, The sports get softer even though it's not stayed in the shoot music.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Okay, So yeah. So now we're gonna move on to like coast activity questions.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:33.000
So what is the most difficult, or what was the most difficult part of trying to find these resources?

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Just like the most difficult part not having any like real like prior knowledge, simply because the popularity of of websites that that help you learn.

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I guess you could say no one really talks about it it's not really like a social thing.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:10.000
So maybe like finding like the best website, I would say, is probably the hardest one.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Second. But here, have you ever had any problems when learning music of any?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Have I had any problems other than like your typical mistakes?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Yeah, other than like mistakes. I have it had any problems.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I would say, maybe like a typical problem, would be like instrument.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Accessibility. It is definitely one of the things that people might have but for me, I don't have any problems.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Yeah, I do agree. Instrument excessibility is really is a problem.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Yeah, when I was learning clarinet in middle school band. we I can't. I come from like a relatively like poor family.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
So it was very hard to find a very affordable clarinet.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Yeah. So then, I got a really cheap one that didn't sound really good. Yeah.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So I think that also like affects your success in your music learning process, too.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Next question is told you to figure out if there are any methods that have the better learning outcome than others like.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Are there any special tricks or like techniques that they use on their you could routine on their website that would stick out to I'm. Not i'm not sure I think the regarding like muse score

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.000
or choosing, choose between news score or like a Pdf website, it would, it would definitely be.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
They definitely have their ups and down or like pros account like for the Pdf website.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:44.000
There's usually like fingerings or like they'll tell you like how like how the song is meant to be played regarding your fingering choice the most like optimal way.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:56.000
But that way thus you won't like come or come across yourself stuttering, because, like, okay, like I have to pause to like readjust, and and they'll just like, tell you like Okay, this: is like or it'll just

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
like show you like us. it's a smooth motion.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I guess you could say on a rather on a new score There's no fingerings from what i've come across.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.000
There's no real fingerings and so if i'm like confused about something.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:27.000
It won't really. Tell me the optimal way to put my hand on the keyboard, and thus I will have to like pause and like, Think about like, Okay, i'll probably have to put my hand here really something do you have

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:35.000
any social activities, such as forums or groups, to learn or get inspiration from currently.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:56.000
For a like music. currently just like currently i'd say like it's mostly just like the games that I play.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
But in the in the past it was mostly in the past.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:14.000
In the past is mostly like. I found myself at many recitals due to my Pm.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Teacher. I felt like most people don't really have that accessibility to like see other people play the song.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:32.000
It really like expands your world, I guess you could say and regards to like what you might want to play like.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Okay. This This person, you know, played this song, and it sounds really really nice like I want to try playing it out, which has happened to be like 2 times 2 or 2 or 2 times, and I did end up playing and and playing at the same

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:57.000
recital playing the same song. Interesting: Okay, we're gonna move on to some.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Can you tell me about a music learning experience that took you a long time?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:21.000
The music learning experience. I would say like it's just like if I found a song really difficult or like cause like it's just so.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:31.000
There's just like too much going on it'd probably take me longer, but other than that, I don't really have any like difficulties.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:42.000
It's just like just repetitive practice. eventually. you Will you will Then you will eventually get to where you want to be.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Okay, Well, is there any method for music learning that you Find yourself repeatedly doing It's like I will I will go back like, if I like, make a mistake and like I keep making mistake? I will just focus on that subsection of music and just like play it.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:24.000
From 1 point to different point in that music, and then, just like, just keep practicing over and over again until I have you. conquered masters, or like, be comfortable with the was my without.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Like, Okay, are there any kinds of music learning where you do not use the Internet?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000
If so, how did you learn like your instrument or your song?

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I would say that I came across my accounts to connections, and I think that oftentimes people don't have that same connection with people.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000
So I think that what I had was pretty pretty rare she's not.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
It's not like someone who posts himself online posts himself. online.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:21.000
It's just like, you know. this person and you just like keep you just keep referring people to to that set person I see so mostly like through your piano teacher.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:32.000
You got like , like the shoes that i'm seeing like in the background right that's all from your your piano teacher, and not from the Internet.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Yes, I think that my count here provided me a lot of things that I did not have to think about myself.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:57.000
And I think that that was pretty nice. okay so I Guess it's.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:13.000
It's been like an hour already, we can wrap up. But my last question is, if you could create a medical tool that would allow you to learn music as you want, what with such tool or what was such a tool be and how would

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:21.000
it work, and what areas would it cover a magical tool to help you with learning?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Give me 1 one moment. take your suit time there's is a hard question.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Maybe like it's So absurd it's like it's not really like a kind of like a tool just like the ability to like slow down time. i'm not really sure just like because like playing so fast but like

01:09:37.000 --> 01:10:07.000
i'm sure like you can probably do on your own just like you're gonna like It's like this part is like really hard, probably, like you just you just play slow on your own like, Do you think that would make the learning

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:18.000
process a lot easier. And how would it work? Actually, I think that a way to for a learning for the learning process?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:48.000
To be easier is to just it's like Okay, how about

01:10:50.000 --> 01:11:04.000
I try to inspire You like something that's kind of like use score, but you can like write on it, and like you can also have it automatically.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Scroll through your right like that's pretty cool Yes, right so something like that.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Yeah, something like that, something like that. the ability to to like.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:24.000
So right on the C music. the pages will turn on a lot for you.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:32.000
And yeah, yeah, that that is such a good good point.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I completely forgot that little bit. I mean if there's anything else that you think would be really helpful like any sort of like tips.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:12:04.000
I guess you could say like on common hard spots in like comments on the side on like how like maybe you can practice this this like, said said Park.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I realized that, like one of the things that also helped me in the past, that I would have never figured out for myself.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Must. a teacher said something it would probably be like to play is a a song in the a different rhythm.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:27.000
So once you come back to the normal rhythm like the easier rhythm, since it's just like a staple like sound.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I guess you could say it's like it becomes easier to play, and I feel like that.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Tip helped me, and I would have never thought of it myself.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:47.000
So I think, having other like credible people telling you like on how to like improve would be very nice on the site.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Oh, okay. So I've been asking you a lot of questions. Is there anything you want to ask me before we end?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:10.000
No, I don't think I do thank you so much for your time and participation.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I know this is a very long session, but it was very insightful.
