## I**ntroduction**

Okay, hello! How are you today?

> I’m doing good, doing good.
> 

Yeah, thank you for participating.

> Mhm, of course.
> 

Give me one second.

So, I’ll just start off with information. So, we're not evaluating you in any way, but we're learning from you about how you look for information online and what works and doesn't work for you. With this, we hope we can design better for people like you. There are no right or wrong answers to any of the questions I'm asking - and we're simply interested in understanding how you do things concerning learning musical instruments, whether it is learning a song or the instrument itself. We will conduct this study mostly as a discussion - so I will ask you to show me how you do things and ask you questions to better understand what you do.

> Okay.
> 

Okay, so the session is going to be structured like this. We'll ask you a few general questions about how you engage with music and learning it. Then we'll go through the activities you may do when learning music for us. While you are working on the music learning tasks, we'd like you to think out aloud, which means you give a running commentary of what's going on in your mind. You can talk about things you like or don't like. Feel free to say anything that comes to your mind.

> Okay.
> 

I will record a voice audio recording of you so that I can go back and review things later for our research. We won't use your name in connection with the recordings or the results. The audio file will only be used internally and never shared anywhere with anyone.

So yeah, how does all that sound to you? Do you have any questions at this point? Let me know if you do not consent to any part of this activity.

> All sounds good. And no questions
> 

## **Background questions**

Okay, let me ask you some background questions then. So could you tell us your name and your occupation?

> My name is [omitted], and I am a student.
> 

Okay. Do you often practice and learn musical instruments? Tell me about your background of instrument learning.

> Nowadays, I don’t practice as much, but I have around 10 years of piano and I have roughly 6 years of playing the flute in school and I was in the middle school and high school band for a year, and yeah, that’s about it.
> 

Okay. What would you say is the instrument you are most skilled at?

> The piano.
> 

Are there any instruments you have always wanted to learn, or stopped learning in the past?

> As a child, I wanted to learn how to play the violin, however, I was debating between playing the piano or violin as I only had time for one, and I ended up with the piano, however, I realized that most of my friends in high school played the violin, or the viola, I think I definitely regret not learning violin in the end.
> 

Hm, I see. I think a lot more people play piano though.

> Haha, it was more of a social thing in high school.
> 

So people think you’re cooler if you know how to play violin.

> Yes.
> 

Interesting. So, where do you usually learn new songs for your main instrument?

> At home, I’d say? Or before, it would be at my piano teachers place, where she would give me new music to learn, and I typically wouldn’t have to choose what type of new music I would really like. She would just give me a set of options and I would choose. Nothing that I was like, I definitely want to play this song. I was mostly indifferent about everything.
> 

Mhm. Do you think this music is accessible to you?

> Music is mostly accessible, I’d say.
> 

Okay. What do you usually do to learn an instrument?

> What do you mean by that?
> 

Like, what methods and ways do you learn an instrument?

> Just practicing it over and over again is the main way, I’d say.
> 

So, repetitive practicing.

> Yes, repetitive practicing. Also, sometimes in the past, I would watch youtube videos of professional pianists to learn how they play it and try to mimic their sounds.
> 

Who is your favorite professional pianist?

> Hold on, give me one moment. Hold on, I have him, I swear. Yes. No, I don’t have him. I forgot. Tip of tongue.
> 

I see. Is this the only instrument you use at the moment? And so you share this instrument with other people? We are talking about the piano.

> This is the only instrument I am using right now, and only I use it.
> 

I see. And how much time per week do you play the piano?

> Currently or in the past?
> 

Mm. Currently. Maybe both. Currently and in the past, in hours.

> Usually, in the past, It’d be an hour per day. But now, it would probably be like, recently, it would be like an hour per week, I’d say.
> 

Okay, so I’ll move on to a more specific set of questions.

How often, throughout your daily life, do you set aside time to learn a musical instrument or a new song?

> Maybe like, I’d set off the weekend, maybe like two days to learn a new song. And it’d last around two hours? Two hours I’d say?
> 

I see. How well does learning said instrument/song work for you? Do you usually have success when looking up specific sheet music to play, or when you want to figure out what something means?

> Regarding the sheet music, I would say, it is half accessible and half inaccessible, simply because the main website where you get sheet music is a little, you typically have to, I think, pay for some of them, I’m not sure, I’ve not really done it, there are some websites where you can get free sheet music. I’d say that looking at sheet music, like typically new ones that you haven’t seen before on your phone or whatever device that you’re using is a little hard to read, and I feel like it could be better in that sense on learning new music.
> 

Mhm. I agree. What kind of methods do you usually use for the instrument and song learning process? And what kind of information or tools do you need?

> Other than repetitive practice, I would say a teacher is pretty helpful, especially when you don’t have that much experience in said instrument, and other than YouTube, I’d say definitely a teacher that can show you, live, in person, or over call, to tell you, okay, this is what you should do, in the instant, rather than you having to figure out your own mistakes. Yeah.
> 

Mhm. Okay. So, which resources would you say that you use the most?

> To find sheet music or just like, in general?
> 

For like, instrument learning and sheet music.

> I would say, I don’t know if this counts—I’d say YouTube, because they usually have the sheet music that they use in the description, and also it’s like a live demonstration on how a song is meant to be played as well. Currently.
> 

How did you come to realize that you could use YouTube to help you in this music learning process?

> It was like, I didn’t know what else to do. I realized that there are people who produce their own sheet music for free, and it was like, it was pretty convenient, I would say, when I’m trying to find a live demonstration on how a song is supposed to be played and finding new sheet music. Accessible sheet music.
> 

Accessible sheet music.

> That of which I can print out.
> 

Mhm. So, do you ever use apps or websites to learn music, I know that GuitarTabs is very common.

> Not particularly.
> 

I see.

> Yes.
> 

Do you read forums to find answers for your musical instrument-learning related questions?

> Sometimes, I think I would read on Reddit, I don’t know the specific group but they typically tell you how, when I had trouble finding my fingering on my own for a music, it would be like, I turn to Reddit, or like, the most like, optimal way to play a specific song, simply because I’d say, like, the chord progression is too big for your hand, and they’d tell you a more efficient or optimal way, if you have smaller hands, to play specific music.
> 

Mhm. Okay. With the methods you mentioned, what do you do to get inspired? What motivates you to learn and practice new music?

> Mostly just, I’d say 5% of it is like a social thing, and the rest of it I just do for myself, I think that I just come across a song that sounds pretty nice and be like, yeah, I want to try playing it. I want to try producing the sound, maybe, I guess you could say, on my own. And when I completely master the song, I can feel proud of myself and I think that it sounds really nice, I can make the music sound how I want it to sound, if I think that a different iteration of music played differently would sound better, and do that, and just like a little bit of experimentation at times.
> 

I see. So, in your view, what is the most useful source of information for music learning? I know you mentioned YouTube, but is that the most useful source of information?

> As I am not really, because I didn’t have to go through the process of actually learning the music instrument on my own, I always had a teacher there with me, I don’t think I really had any other website or learning app that I used, simply because my teacher only recommended YouTube and I was like, this is the most efficient way. I just watched and played. Yeah.
> 

Mhm. Okay, thank you. Now we are going to move on to some music learning activities.

> Mhm.
> 

## Observing u**ser's music learning activities**

So, right now, I would like to give you some time to think about a situation or a time where you want to become more skilled at something, which can be anything, like getting better at a game, or a school subject. How would you go about finding resources on how to become more skilled at that thing that you are thinking about? You can use any websites you would like, and think aloud as you do your task to your liking. Think of an example, something you would normally think about becoming more skilled in.

> Okay. I guess you could say how learning a new subject in school, I would typically, my first option would be to search online.
> 

Oh, can you show me?

> Through the screen?
> 

Yes.

> Okay. Let’s do... a game.
> 

So, what are you thinking about? What game do you want to get better at?

> Is it okay if you enable screen sharing? Okay, so... [thinking]
> 

Oh, it doesn’t have to be a game, it was just an example, just anything.

> Anything, haha. [thinking] We can do a game. So let’s say, League of Legends [googles League of Legends]. Typically if I wanted to get better at this said game, if I had any specific questions, like I wanted to learn how to get better at CS-ing. Typically, the best way I learn through trial and error, would be to go on Reddit, and a specific subreddit called “Summoner School.” [Opens r/summonerschool]. It’s like a specific Reddit answering all questions in depth, pretty in depth, simply because when you’re trying to find the answer to a question, usually in my perspective, when I’m looking for an answer or something, I’d usually skim through something, the comment section, to see if I’m looking for, or if I find a correct answer it should be pretty short-ish, I would say. Or like, usually, the comments that would grab my attention are the short ones that are concise and I want to make sure that there are also other comments verifying the credibility of a person’s statement. It’s like this. Usually the comments are pretty long, so I don’t usually end up reading everything, but usually I’ll skim through the comments if anything grabs my eye I’ll read it, and I’ll then apply it into the game as well and see, hey this really does work out, or if anything, once I’m done with this, and I realize that I cannot learn anything more, I’ll usually ask—or look for a coach or something.
> 

> Usually though this Reddit, there are weekly sessions for people to get coaching from through discussion forum and mentor thread. It’s usually like, all the people sign up. You basically put in your information, or you find a coach that intrigues you. Typically, you state the reason why you want to be coached, and then you will meet with your own coach. And then once that is done, if I still have any questions, then it’s usually just repetitive practice into becoming better, I would say. And that is typically how it goes, I would say.
> 

How interesting. You can do a lot on this subreddit. I guess you mentioned Reddit earlier too, do you think Reddit is a really good place to learn more about something you want to get more experience or skills in?

> Yeah, I would say that it’s pretty good at helping you, simply because it’s been around for so long, and it’s basically like a library of knowledge. Because it’s been around for so long. Usually there are people with the same questions in the past, and if there’s like a pretty small question, I would say because of how long it has been out for, there is probably someone who has answered your question.
> 

So what made you think about doing this task?

> What do you mean by something that made me want to do this task? Like it was just comfort, would have done in the past
> 

Okay, and how did you decide what method to use?

> Usually I would try asking for advice from friends, I’d try searching online, there are forums for this said game, however I realized that a more efficient way is a forum specifically dedicated to learning or answering any of your questions. Also, I think that there are videos on different websites that are designed for you to learn, are sometimes a little too long, and I realized that simply just reading would be faster. If a video is too long then I would typically skip over it.
> 

How much time would you spend on this specific subreddit, learning things? And do you post at all?

> Mostly, it takes about 30 minutes, I just read a little bit and I don’t think I have any posts, but that’s simply because I just, typically the questions I’ve had are already there (because it has been around for so long). So I don’t have to post.
> 

Would you ever see yourself posting though?

> Yeah, I’d see myself posting. Other than requesting a mentor, typically I didn’t have to post because I would just go through the mentoring process. Actually, I have posted once, and then someone answered. Specific, if this happened, you would do this, this or this. They’ve told me a logical way of going through a specific situation in the game.
> 

Interesting. Are you satisfied with the method you used for this activity? How do you decide if you have mastered what you want to learn?

> How do I decide what I mastered? Or if I mastered?
> 

Yes, if you mastered.

> So typically... sorry could you repeat the first part of the question?
> 

Are you satisfied with the method you used for this activity?

> Yes I am satisfied. Simply because, I do end up learning and I do come out with a positive result. I did get what I wanted and then i would apply it in the actual game. Also, regarding if I mastered what I wanted, it is a competitive game. The higher ranks you go, the more you improve, you will see numbers display to display how much you have improved and the more you play the more it will show your average set of skill. Once you’ve reached a high enough rating I guess you could say, then you could say I have mastered what I have been doing.
> 

Okay. I guess, why did you choose Reddit? Why did it seem good to you?

> It’s like there are other websites to “better” yourself I guess you could say. [shows Mobalytics.com] Simply because it’s a little more confusing I guess you could say. It’s not as in-depth as I would like. Lets say for example, this subreddit, they go pretty in-depth and it maps out every single situation or most of the situations you could be in. For this one, the UI is a little harder to use, it doesn’t tell you everything, it tells you the top layer of things. That’s typically how it goes for a lot of the websites. I found that Reddit just because you’re searching the questions; most of the websites don’t have the search function that Reddit has and I found that just using this subreddit is the most optimal way.
> 

Interesting.

> I would say the design is pretty simple, it’s easy to understand rather than using this website where you have to explore, try to find out what everything means. I think that sometimes it is a little too much for people who don’t understand what’s going on; it could be better. This is typically how it goes for most of the websites.
> 

Interesting that you find the website harder to use than Reddit. 

Okay, so now I’m going to move on and I will now ask you to demonstrate some activities, two activities, that are more music learning related. The first one would be about learning or brushing up your skills on an instrument and the second one is learning a new song on a particular instrument of choice. Let’s do that. When you’re doing these tasks, use whatever websites and tools you’d normally use, and please think aloud.

> Okay.
> 

So for the first task, can you show me how you would go about finding resources on learning or brushing up on your skills in a musical instrument?

> Um, so for brushing up I would typically just use Muse score right now as that is the best way currently off the top of my head. I would say having the ability to see the song and play it out in a robotic manner is useful. There could be improvements.
> 

Would you say that Musescore helps you learn an instrument though? Like if you wanted to learn the violin again would you use Musescore? 

> No I would not use Musescore. If I wanted to learn violin again I would first search the basics of learning violin *in the google search function.* I would probably watch a shorter video or packed video. I know that learning the violin, there are a lot of steps so it looks like the first episode as you can see with the layout. It tells you all the basics at the bottom. Let’s say like the proper way to hold the violin, the shoulder rest, the A string, all the different strings. Rather than this one, where it says lesson one out of twenty I’m less inclined to click it simply because it is twelve minutes long and it only shows you how to hold the violin. I would probably watch the video and if I’m still interested, maybe not WikiHow but this one sounds this one looks pretty interesting. It’s pretty simple it looks like it has all the basics I would need when I’m trying to relearn the violin as well. And then yea, it looks like this website has everything like an FAQ type of thing when I’m trying to learn the violin again. And that is typically how I would do it. As I currently, I feel like there are not many resources that I know that can help me I would say.
> 

I see. It looks like Violinonline has a ton of articles on different things. So I think it’s pretty informative. 

> Yes.
> 

 How did you decide what method to use?

> Um, just the google search function is the easiest. Whatever came up caught my eye. Let’s say for example the YouTube video, seeing the length of the video, it would also show the subsections, basically to see if the video is pretty simple to find out if that is the video I was actually looking for. If I wanted to learn more, a more in-depth way, I would scroll down to see a website that would catch my eye. Like the other was WikiHow, probably not WikiHow simply because it’s not what I’m looking for. I’m not really sure why, I just want something a little more, a website dedicated to instrument learning or an instrument I would say. Going to this website, I think a thing is that it could be better about this website, simply because it only has pictures, maybe like a short video on how it comes into that position, explaining a one to two minute video explaining everything that is going on could be implemented. However I do think that the pictures are very necessary when you’re trying to learn a new instrument.
> 

I see. I guess how much time would you spend a day learning an instrument like through this method?

> I think definitely in the beginning it takes a little longer just from my experience. So it would probably take like two hours a day for me to be comfortable with where I am at since it definitely takes a little longer for me to learn.
> 

Are you satisfied with the method you used and the website you encountered? How do you decide if you have mastered the violin, or how would you evaluate that?

> I would evaluate that by just feeling the comfortability of whatever task I’m trying to do. I figured that I am pretty satisfied with this method simply because I don’t have a way to really self learn. I don’t really have any real methods, it’s not really talked about, you kind of just do this thing on your own. I’m not sure if I have any other things.
> 

The first part of the question was are you satisfied? 

> Yes.
> 

Are you satisfied with this website?

> I would say that I am satisfied with this website simply because it has all the tips you might need. It also has most or all the information, I can’t really tell right now but it looks like it has all the information you might need to learn all the new instrument setting.
> 

Why did you choose Googling and why did you think that was a good idea?

> It was the most accessible way to figure out whatever needs you may need. It nots like everyone is talking about “Oh this specific website is good for music learning or instrument learning. It has everything that you would probably want. You just keep skimming through the searches and you will probably find what you’re looking for.
> 

Well, thank you for showing me how you performed this task. The next one is more about learning a song so how would you go about learning a new song, from finding the sheet music or finding what you want to learn then finding the sheet music then learning it to its fullest. And preferable on the instrument you already know. The piano. 

> So typically I would use my phone unfortunately as I don’t really have an Ipad or bigger screen accessible to me right now. Then I just use Youtube, I would come across a specific song that I am interested. I typically look through the description of it, to see if I could find anything regarding the sheet music. Often times, I will find myself using Musescore as well, simply because it is the first thing that pops up, most popular. I feel like there are many different iterations of the said sheet music you are trying to learn so I will [lost connection]. After I figure out the song I want to play, I will just on this small small screen. I will try my best to learn just by having whatever I have. So I will skim over the music, I will see if there’s any sort of things that catch my eye. I look at the key signature, I look at the entire music to see if anything is out of place. But it looks like this song is pretty simple in a rhythm sense and there’s no key abnormalities and any sort of symbols that I might not understand. If I did have any questions about understanding a symbol or understanding the music I would just search online. Just a general description of what the symbol is or I would also just click on the Musescore, the notes, since the website will play the music for you. This is probably what it means if I listened to the song. So I will look at the music, I will picture in my head what it’s probably supposed to sound like and I will end up playing it real quick. [plays song] So one of the bad things about having a small screen is having to scroll down every line, which I do find a little irritating and I think maybe if you do have a small screen one of the things that could be implemented is playing at your own tempo and the screen will automatically scroll down for you in a set tempo. So it will follow along with where you’re at as well. I think that it will also help you keep yourself rhythmically in check which will all in all, it will be a better time learning. And then you will keep playing [proceeds to continue playing] And that is typically how I would play the song and I would keep playing it repetitively until I feel like I don’t have to pause or stutter during the song.
> 

I see. Would you say that the scrolling process is cumbersome? As opposed to paper sheet music you can have it laid out in front of you.

> Yes yes yes yes. I also feel like if it did have that scrolling function in said tempo, it also saves paper for you. It’s also tedious to do and it ruins the whole atmosphere for when you’re playing music.
> 

How did you decide what method to use?

I just... the quickest and easiest thing to do is use Musescore. If I really wanted to find a better website I’m sure that I could. Musescore has just like the notes out there, I think that if you’re trying to find a PDF version of music but it ends up a little too small. Simply because they photocopy it. It’s an older website thus you have to zoom in a lot more and that’ll have you scrolling a lot more as well. Also, if you don’t have a printer available to you this is the easiest thing to do.

I see. So, you don’t have a printer?

> Currently unavailable. Otherwise I would try to print out the music.
> 

How much time would you spend a day learning a song in this method?

> I would say an hour, simply because learning a new song would take longer, a lot longer than actual... going through the song one time will take significantly longer than once you’ve reached a comfortable level so it would probably take, if I lose track of myself I would probably take two hours, but on average I would take one hour I would say but for multiple days like three days in a row.
> 

I see I see. Are you satisfied with the method you used for this activity and in this context how do you decide if you mastered that song?

> I would say that I am satisfied simply because it has mostly everything that I need. I don’t think that... actually I think that like the scrolling of the screen does bug me a little. There’s nothing that I can do about it right now. As for mastering the music, once I’ve stopped stuttering and pausing during the music. Once I’ve reached a comfort kind of like, when you master music you kind of memorize the notes, what comes next and it’s like then I would feel like I’ve mastered it.
> 

I see. Thank you. Lastly, why did you decide to use Muse Dash and why does it seem good?

> Why did I choose Muse Dash?
> 

Yes and why does it seem good compared to other options?

> I don’t think I’ve really looked into finding a much better website. This is typically in my opinion the most up to date way to learn the music, or finding new music. It has all the different people trying to create their own sheet music and how they interpret it and that’s about it. It’s pretty simply, it has everything that you are looking for regarding how a song should be played and how it sounds or that’s about it. It’s a pretty simple thing.
> 

I see.

---

Okay, so now I’m going to move on to more general questions. Do you ever record your music learning? If so, how do you document it?

> In the past, I have recorded myself playing. When I do record, I typically want to watch how I play, if I’m making any mistakes, or if this sounds weird, because when you’re playing you often miss things that sound a little weird. If anything, I may not document it on a piece of paper. Actually, I will document on the actual sheet music, like hey, just like a reminder when I come across this again. Like this is a G#, or you played the wrong note, so you mark it on top. And that is typically how it goes.
> 

I see. That makes sense. So you don’t have written notes?

> I don’t particularly have written notes, I would say, just like writing on the actual music. It’s simple [shows sheet music] I would have markings on my page. I have a scribble to make this seem like, it’s becoming slower, even though it’s not stated on the music, I figured that if I put a crescendo, it would sound better, even if it’s not implemented on the actual music. Sometimes, if I’m confused about the rhythm, I would write “1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and” so that I can match the notes with the rhythm.
> 

You brought up a good point about writing on your sheet music. When you’re learning your song earlier on Musescore, you were not able to particularly write on that sheet music, right? Do you think that would be a helpful thing?

> I think that would be an extremely helpful thing to have when you’re learning your songs. Yes. Just so like, you will probably forget when you’re playing through the song again. And it’ll take longer for you to really integrate that into your memory.
> 

Do you think that’s a feature that Musescore needs?

> Yeah, I would say that it’s something that Musescore needs. Let’s say that you’re learning a harder song, there’s just so much going on in your mind, when you come across it again, it probably would not be the first thing you think of, and you would have to play it again. It would probably take 4x as long to fully master the mistake you might have made. Or remember that, this part gets louder or softer even though it’s not stated in the sheet music.
> 

## Follow-up questions

Okay. So, now we are going to move on to post-activity questions.

What was the most difficult part of trying to find these resources?

> The most difficult part, not having any real prior knowledge simply because the popularity of websites that help you learn—no one really talks about it, it’s not really a social thing, so maybe like finding the best website is probably the hardest.
> 

One second.

> Mhm.
> 

Okay. Have you ever had any problems when learning music?

> Other than your typical mistakes?
> 

Yeah. Other than mistakes.

> I haven’t had any probelms, I’d say. Maybe like a typical problem would be instrument accessibility, is definitely one of the things that people might have. But for me I don’t have any problems.
> 

I do agree. Instrument accessibility is a problem. When I was learning clarinet in middle school band, I come from a relatively poor family, so it was very hard to find an affordable clarinet. So then I got a really cheap one that didn’t sound really good. So I think that also affects your music learning process.

The next question is, how would you figure out if there are methods that have a better learning outcome than others? Like are there any special tricks or techniques they use on their website that would stick out to you?

> I’m not sure. Regarding Musescore, or choosing between Musescore and a pdf website, there are definitely pros and cons for each. For the pdf website, there are usually fingerings or they would tell you how the song is meant to be played regarding your fingering and playing in the most optimal way thus you won’t come across yourself stuttering, because I have to pause to readjust. It would show you a smooth motion. Rather on Musescore, there are no real fingerings from what I’ve come across. So if I am confused about something, it would not tell me the optimal way to put my hands on the keyboard.
> 

Mhm. Do you have social activities, such as forums or groups, to learn or get inspiration from? Currently for music learning?

> Currently, it’s mostly just the games that I play. But in the past, it was mostly, I found myself at many recitals due to my piano teacher. I felt like most people don’t really have that accessibility to see other people play a song, it really expands your world in regards to what you might want to play. Like, this person played this song, and it sounds really nice. I want to try playing it now. Which has happened to me like two or three times and I did end up playing the same song at the same recital.
> 

Interesting. Okay, we’re going to move on to some different questions. Can you tell me about a music learning experience that took you a long time?

> If I found a song really difficult, because if there’s too much going on, it would probably take me longer. But other than that, I don’t really have difficulties. It’s just repetitive practice and eventually, you will get to where you want to be.
> 

Is there any method for music learning that you find yourself repeatedly doing?

> If I make a mistake and I keep making the mistake, I would keep focusing on that subsection of music and play it, and keep practicing over and over until I have “mastered” or become comfortable with how I’m playing.
> 

Are there any kinds of music learning where you do not use the internet? If so, how did you learn your instrument or your song?

> I came across my piano teacher through connections, and I think that often times people don’t have that same connection with people, so I think what I had was pretty rare. As it is not someone who posts themselves online. It’s just like, you know this person and you keep referring people to that said person.
> 

I see. So mostly through your piano teacher you got the sheets that I’m seeing in the background, that’s all from your piano teacher and not from the internet?

> Yes. I think that my piano teacher provided me with a lot of things that I did not have to think about myself, and I think that was pretty nice.

Okay, so I guess it’s been an hour already. We can wrap up.

## **Wrap-up**

And the last question is, if you could create a magical tool that would allow you to learn music as you want, what would such a tool be? How would it work? What areas would it cover?

> A magical tool? To help you with learning.... [thinking] Give me one moment.
> 

Take your sweet time.

> That is a hard question. Maybe, so absurd. It’s kind of like a tool? The ability to slow down time? I’m not really sure. Because you’re playing so fast, I’m sure you can do it on your own. You can play slower on your own, but like, um...
> 

Do you think that would make the learning process a lot easier? How would it work?

> Actually, I think a way for the learning process to be easier is to [silence]

Okay, how about I try to inspire you. Something that’s kind of like Musescore, but you can write on it, and have it automatically scroll for you, right? Like that’s pretty cool, right? Something like that?

> Yeah, something like that. The ability to write on the sheet music, the pages will turn automatically for you, and yeah. That is such a good point. I completely forgot about that.
> 

Is there anything else you think would be really helpful?

> Tips and comments on common hard spots. How maybe you can practice this said part. I realized that one of the things that also helped me in the past that I would’ve never figured out for myself had my teacher said something is to play a song in a different rhythm and so once you come back to the normal rhythm, it becomes easier to play. And I feel like that tip helped me and I would have never thought about it myself. So I think that having other credible people telling you how to improve is really nice—on the side.

Okay. I've been asking you a lot of questions. Is there anything you want to ask me before we end?

> No, I don’t think I do.
> 

Okay, well thank you so much for your time and participation. I know this was a very long session, but it was very insightful. I will end the recording.

> Thank you.
