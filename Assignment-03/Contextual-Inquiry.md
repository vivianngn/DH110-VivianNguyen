# Assignment #3: Contextual Inquiry

**Vivian Nguyen** | *Digital Humanities 110 - User Interface and Design* | Spring 2022****

## Introduction 👋🏻

After conducting heuristic evaluation and usability testing, I realized that I needed to know more about the behavior, background, and user experiences of my target audience.

## Step 1. Specify the design challenge 💭

**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**

- **Musical instrument learning** with teachers potential students can connect with, with features related to pairing students and teachers and scheduling lessons (can be virtual and in-person). There would be prerecorded lessons (like Khan Academy) as well that are open for everyone without the need for interaction.
- **Song learning** with a database of accessible sheet music for any instrument. It would be interactive.

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**

- The basic need these activities fulfill includes the **desire to learn and hone their skills** in music. My project hopes to make people of all backgrounds feel like they can learn music without any barriers, whether it is resources or money.

**What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

- Most instrument learners would find a music instructor through advertisements or mutual friends, although the selection is always limited, and older users might feel too embarrassed to ask around. Some users look up YouTube tutorials on how to learn an instrument. Currently, many people don’t really consider the option of taking virtual musical instrument lessons. There are also not many resources on the internet that provide information on a wider scope of music learning.

**What are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**

- Limitations on looking for a perfect fit **music teacher** would be improved, as you would be exposed to a list that would fit your needs.**.**
- Limitations on **sheet music accessibility** would be improved through my proposed project idea, as currently, a lot of sheet music is paid.

## Step 2. Target users 👤

**What are the characteristics of users?**

- Demographics: My project would ideally be fit for people of all ages and backgrounds (e.g. kids, young-adults, adults, elderly, disadvantaged).
- Preferences: Users would be interested in the idea of taking advantage of the internet to learn music.
- Expertise: People of all levels of expertise are welcome. Those finding sheet music would probably have knowledge of musical instruments, and those looking for prerecorded lessons are likely to have no expertise.

**In which context would the users do that activity?**

- Users would probably learn music within the vicinity of their own home, or institution, where instruments are located. Sometimes, a mobile device can be used to read sheet music, but mostly, it is through sheets of paper. Instrument learning through online methods would be more device usage heavy.

**What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**

- When learning a musical instrument, users would typically have an instructor by their side. However, due to COVID, it is becoming much more common to have online lessons. If that is the case, then a device would be used to connect the material with the user.
- When learning a new song through sheet music, the sources can include online sources, printed paper, or a paper book.

## Step 3. Research Methods 🧪

I decided to use **interview, participatory interaction** of the user and **observation** as my primary research methods.

For the interview and observation session, I followed a script that had the following structure:

1. Background questions
2. Observing user’s music learning activities
3. Follow-up questions

**I had my subject perform three activities:**

| Activity 1 (general) | Activity 2 (music learning) | Activity 3 (music learning) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A general activity with a desire to work on a skill | Learning/brushing up on an instrument | Learning a song on an instrument of choice |

The first activity was conducted on the subject’s phone. The second and third activities were conducted in the subject’s own home, by a piano, with a phone in hand. I used Zoom to record the audio of the interview and the laptop camera to observe. However, for privacy reasons, the video of the session will be kept confidential. Because of schedule conflicts, I was unable to come to their home in-person, so we opted for a remote Zoom call.
