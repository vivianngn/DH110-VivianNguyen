## Introduction (5 mins)

Hi [name], how are you today? Thank you for participating!

We're not evaluating you in any way, but we're learning from you about how you look for information online and what works and doesn't work for you. With this, we hope we can design better for people like you. There are no right or wrong answers to any of the questions I'm asking in this study - we're simply interested in understanding how you do things concerning learning musical instruments, whether it is learning a song or the instrument itself. We will conduct this study mostly as a discussion - I will ask you to show me how you do things and ask you questions to better understand what you do.

Here's how the session's going to be scheduled. We'll ask you a few general questions about how you engage with music and learning it. Then we'll go through the activities you may do when learning music for us. While you are working on the music learning tasks, we'd like you to think out aloud, which means you give a running commentary of what's going on in your mind. You can talk about things you like or don't like. Feel free to say anything that comes to your mind.

I will record a voice audio recording of you so that I can go back and review things later for our research. We won't use your name in connection with the recordings or the results. The audio file will only be used internally and never shared anywhere with anyone.

How does all that sound to you? Do you have any questions at this point? Let me know if you do not consent to any part of this activity.

## Background (10 mins)

3. What would you say is the instrument you are most skilled at?
4. Are there any instruments you have always wanted to learn, or stopped learning in the past?
5. Where do you usually learn new songs for your main instrument?

## Contextual Inquiry

1. **Frequency of activities:** How often, throughout your daily life, do you set aside time to learn a musical instrument or a new song?
2. **Success of music learning:** How well does learning a musical instrument/song work for you? Do you usually have success when looking up specific sheet music to play, or when you want to figure out what something means on the sheet music?
3. **Goals of music learning activities:** What kind of methods do you usually use for the instrument/song learning process? What kind of information or tools do you need?

### Resources for music learning activities:

1. What resources do you use for your instrument/song learning?
    1. Which resources do you use the most?

        2. How did you hear about it?
2. How do you come to know this resource?
3. Do you ever use apps or websites to learn music?
4. Do you read forums to find answers for your musical instrument-learning related questions?
5. With the method(s) you mentioned, what do you do to get inspired? What motivates you to learn/practice new music?

## User's music learning activities (35 minutes)

### Observation

Now Iâ€™d like to give you some time to think about a situation or a time where you want to become more skilled at something (can be anything, like getting better at a game, or a school subject). How would you find resources on how to become more skilled at that? Use any website you would like, and think aloud as you do your task to your liking. Think of an example, something you would normally think about becoming more skilled in.

1. **Origin of task:** What made you think about doing this task? 
2. **Strategy:** How did you decide what method to use?
3. **Time spent:** How much time would you spend on this task, typically?
4. **Satisfaction:** Are you satisfied with the method you used for this activity? How do you decide if you have mastered what you want to learn?
5. **Results assessment:** Why did you choose this particular method? Can you explain why it seems particularly good?

### Music learning specific

We are now asking you to demonstrate some activities on how you would 1) learn or brush up on your skills in an instrument, and 2) learn a new song on a particular instrument of choice. Let's do them! When you're doing these tasks, use whatever websites/tools you'd normally use, and please think aloud.

**01. Learning an instrument**

1. **Task:** Can you show me how you would go about finding resources on learning or brushing up on your skills in a musical instrument?
2. **Strategy:** How did you decide what method to use?
3. **Time spent:** How much time would you spend a day learning an instrument in this way?
4. **Satisfaction:** Are you satisfied with the method you used for this activity? How do you decide if you have mastered what you want to learn?
5. **Results assessment:** Why did you choose this particular method? Can you explain why it seems particularly good?

**02. Learning a song**

1. **Task:** How would you go about learning a new song, from finding the sheet music to learning it to its fullest?
2. **Strategy:** How did you decide what method to use?
3. **Time spent:** How much time would you spend a day learning a song in this way?
4. **Satisfaction:** Are you satisfied with the method you used for this activity? How do you decide if you have mastered what you want to learn?
5. **Results assessment:** Why did you choose this particular method? Can you explain why it seems particularly good?

## Identifying problems with the music learning process

2. Have you ever had any problems when learning music?
3. How would you figure out if there are methods that have a better learning outcome than others?
    1. Any special tricks or techniques they use that stick out to you?

## Different methods for music learning process (5 mins)

## Wrap-up (5 min)

**Desires:** If you could create a magical tool that would allow you to learn music as you want, what would such a tool be? How would it work? What areas would it cover?

I've been asking you a lot of questions. Is there anything you want to ask me?
